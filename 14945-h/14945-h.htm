<h2>PREFACE.</h2>

  <p>Three years ago Mr. James S. Reid, of Gonville and Caius College,
  Cambridge, prepared for the Syndics of the University Press editions of
  Cicero's <i>Cato Maior de Senectute</i> and <i>Laelius de Amicitia.</i>
  The thorough and accurate scholarship displayed, especially in the
  elucidation of the Latinity, immediately won for the books a cordial
  reception; and since then they have gained a permanent place in the
  esteem of English scholars.</p>

  <p>The present volume has the full authorization of Mr. Reid, and was
  prepared with the design of presenting to American students, in a form
  best adapted to their use, the results of his work. The Text remains
  substantially that of Mr. Reid; while mention is made in the notes of the
  most important variations in readings and orthography from other
  editions. The Introductions have been recast, with some enlargement; the
  analyses of the subject-matter in particular have been entirely
  remodelled. The Notes have been in some instances reduced, in others
  amplified,&mdash;especially by the addition of references to the standard
  treatises on grammar, history, and philosophy. It was at first the
  intention of the American editor to indicate by some mark the matter due
  to himself; but as this could hardly be done without marring the
  appearance of the page, and thus introducing a source of confusion to the
  student, it was not attempted. In the work of revision free use of the
  principal German and English editions has been made.</p>

  <p>To some the notes of the present edition may appear too copious. The
  aim throughout, however, has been not simply to give aid on difficult
  points, but to call attention to the finer usages of the Latin, and to
  add also whatever explanation seemed necessary to a clear understanding
  of the subject-matter. Latin scholarship which shall be at the same time
  broad and accurate, including not only a mastery of the language but also
  a comprehensive view of the various phases of Roman life and thought,
  will, it is believed, be best assured by the slow and careful reading of
  some portions of the literature and by the rapid survey of others.
  Certainly of the shorter Latin classics few would more fully repay close
  and careful study of both language and thought than these charming
  colloquies on Old Age and Friendship. While almost faultless in
  expression, they embody in a remarkable degree that universal element
  which characterizes the literary masterpiece, and makes it the valued
  possession not merely of an age or a nation, but of all time.</p>

<h2>INTRODUCTION.</h2>

<h3>I. CICERO AS A WRITER ON PHILOSOPHY.</h3>

<h4>(i.) STATE OF PHILOSOPHY IN CICERO'S TIME.</h4>

  <p>In Philosophy the Romans originated nothing. Their energies in the
  earlier years of the state were wholly absorbed in organization and
  conquest. Resting in a stern and simple creed, they had little
  speculative interest in matters outside the hard routine of their daily
  life. But with the close of the Period of Conquest came a change. The
  influx of wealth from conquered provinces, the formation of large landed
  estates, the excessive employment of slave labor, and the consequent rise
  of a new aristocracy, prepared the way for a great revolution. The old
  religion lost its hold on the higher classes; something was needed to
  take its place. With wealth and luxury came opportunity and desire for
  culture. Greece, with Art, Literature, and Philosophy fully developed and
  highly perfected, stood ready to instruct her rude conqueror.<a
  name="NtA_1"></a><a href="#Nt_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>

  <p>In Cicero's time the productive era of Greek Philosophy had well-nigh
  passed. Its tendency was less speculative, more ethical and practical
  than in the earlier time. There were four prominent schools, the New
  Academy, the Peripatetic, the Stoic, and the Epicurean. The supporters of
  the last-named advocated in Science the doctrine of the atom, in Ethics
  the pursuit of pleasure, in Religion the complete inactivity of the
  gods.</p>

<!-- Page ii --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii"></a>[ii]</span>

  <p>The Stoics and Peripatetics were divided by comparatively unimportant
  differences. In Ethics, considered by them as almost the whole of
  Philosophy, which was itself defined as 'the art of living', the main
  question between the two schools was the amount of importance to be
  attributed to Virtue,&mdash;the Stoics declaring that in comparison with
  Virtue all other things sink into absolute insignificance, while the
  Peripatetics maintained that these have a certain though infinitesimally
  small significance. The New Academy taught at this time no complete
  philosophical system. It simply proclaimed the view that in the field of
  knowledge certainty is unattainable, and that all the inquirer has to do
  is to balance probabilities one against the other. The New Academic,
  therefore, was free to accept any opinions which seemed to him to have
  the weight of probability on their side, but he was bound to be ready to
  abandon them when anything appeared which altered his views of the
  probabilities. He not only might be, but he could not help being,
  <i>eclectic</i>; that is, he chose such views promulgated by other
  schools as seemed to him at the moment to be most reasonable or probable.
  Cicero called himself an adherent of this school. On most points however,
  although eclectic, he agreed with the Peripatetics, but with a decided
  leaning toward the Stoic ethical system. The Stoic opinion that it is the
  duty of the wise man to abstain from public life, which the Peripatetics
  contested, Cicero decisively rejected. With the Epicureans he had
  absolutely no sympathy. Up to this time these schools and their teachings
  were known to the Romans only through the medium of the Greek. The only
  Latin philosophical literature was Epicurean, and, excepting the poem of
  Lucretius (<i>De Rerum Natura</i>), scarcely famous as yet, consisted
  entirely of books rudely written, although considerably read.</p>

<h4>(ii.) THE MISSION OF CICERO IN PHILOSOPHY.</h4>

  <p>Cicero made no claim to originality as a philosopher, nor even to
  complete acquaintance with every detail of the Greek systems.<a
  name="NtA_2"></a><a href="#Nt_2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> <!-- Page iii --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii"></a>[iii]</span> In early life he had
  studied with enthusiasm and success all the learning of the Greeks, but
  especially in the two departments of Rhetoric and Philosophy, then
  closely connected, or rather hardly distinguished. He not only sought the
  society of learned Greeks, but spent considerable time in study at Rhodes
  and Athens, which had become not merely the 'school of Greece', as
  Thucydides makes Pericles call her, but the school of the civilized
  world.<a name="NtA_3"></a><a href="#Nt_3"><sup>[3]</sup></a> When, by
  reason of political troubles, he was forced to retire to private life, he
  began to carry out a great plan for interpreting the best philosophical
  writings of the Greeks to his fellow-countrymen. For this work his
  liberal views as a New Academic peculiarly fitted him. His usual method
  was to take one or two leading Greek works on the subject with which he
  was dealing, and to represent freely in his own language their
  subject-matter, introducing episodes and illustrations of his own. He
  thus presented to the Romans in their own tongue the most significant
  portions of the Greek Philosophy; and in his writings there has come down
  to us much, especially of the Post-Aristotelian Philosophy, that was
  doomed to oblivion in the original Greek. But further than this, to
  Cicero more than to any other Roman is due the formation of a Latin
  philosophical vocabulary, by which the language was enriched and fitted
  for the part it has since taken as the Language of the Learned. While on
  many points Cicero's own views can hardly be determined with perfect
  exactness, the exalted sentiments and the exquisite literary finish of
  his philosophical writings have always won admiration; and through them
  he has exerted no small influence on the literature and life of modern
  times.<a name="NtA_4"></a><a href="#Nt_4"><sup>[4]</sup></a></p>

<!-- Page iv --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv"></a>[iv]</span>

<h4>(iii.) THE PHILOSOPHICAL WRITINGS OF CICERO.</h4>

  <p>During the whole of an exceptionally busy public life Cicero devoted
  his spare moments to reading and to the society of the learned. After his
  exile in 58 and 57 B.C. his political career, except for a brief period
  just before his death, was over, and it is at this time that his period
  of great literary activity begins, In 55 he produced the work <i>De
  Oratore</i>, in 54 the <i>De Re Publica</i>, and in 52 the <i>De
  Legibus</i>, all three works, according to ancient ideas, entitled to
  rank as philosophical.<a name="NtA_5"></a><a
  href="#Nt_5"><sup>[5]</sup></a></p>

  <p>From 51 to 46 B.C., owing first to his absence in Cilicia, then to the
  civil troubles, Cicero almost ceased to write. But in the latter year he
  was reconciled with Caesar, and as the Senate and law courts were closed
  against him on his refusal to compromise his political principles, he
  betook himself with greater devotion than ever to literature. The first
  work written in 46 was the <i>Hortensius</i>, or <i>De Philosophia</i>,
  now lost. It was founded on a lost dialogue of Aristotle, and set forth
  the advantages of studying Philosophy. During the same year Cicero
  completed several oratorical works, the <i>Partitiones Oratoriae</i>, the
  <i>Brutus</i>, or <i>De Claris Oratoribus</i>, and the <i>Orator</i>, all
  of which are extant.</p>

  <p>Early in 45 Cicero lost his beloved daughter Tullia. He passed the
  whole year in retirement, trying to soothe his grief by incessant
  writing. In quick succession appeared</p>

  <p><i>De Consolatione</i>, an attempt to apply philosophy to the
  mitigation of his own sorrow and that of others;</p>

  <p><i>Academica</i>, an exposition of the New Academic Philosophy,
  advocating probability rather than certainty as the foundation of
  philosophy;</p>

  <p><i>De Finibus Bonorum et Malorum</i>, a work criticising the most
  prominent views entertained concerning Ethics;</p>

  <p><i>Disputationes Tusculanae</i>, treating of certain conditions
  essential to morality and happiness;</p>

<!-- Page v --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v"></a>[v]</span>

  <p><i>De Natura Deorum</i>, an examination of the principal theories
  regarding the nature and power of the gods;</p>

  <p><i>Cato Maior</i>, on old age; <i>Laelius</i>, on friendship;</p>

  <p><i>De Fato</i>, discussing Fate and Free Will;</p>

  <p><i>Paradoxa</i>, a book setting forth certain remarkable views of the
  Stoics;</p>

  <p><i>De Officiis</i>, a treatise on practical ethics, the application of
  moral principles to the questions and difficulties of ordinary life.</p>

  <p>These works, written mostly in 45 and 44, are, except the <i>De
  Cons.,</i> still extant. To the list may be added also other works of a
  rhetorical nature, such as the <i>Topica</i> and <i>De Optima Genere
  Dicendi</i>, and some lost philosophical books, such as <i>De
  Gloria</i>.</p>

  <p>Even though allowance be made for the fact that Cicero was giving in
  Latin the substance of Greek books with which he had been familiar from
  boyhood, the mental vigor and literary power exhibited by this series of
  works appear prodigious when we consider their great compass and variety
  and the generally high finish of their style.</p>

<h3>II. THE CATO MAIOR.</h3>

<h4>(i.) ORIGIN AND SCOPE.</h4>

<p class="center">1. <i>Date and Circumstances of Composition.</i></p>

  <p>The date at which the Cato Maior was written can be determined with
  almost perfect exactness. A mention in Cicero's work entitled <i>De
  Divinatione</i><a name="NtA_6"></a><a href="#Nt_6"><sup>[6]</sup></a> shows
  that the Cato Maior preceded that work by a short time. The <i>De
  Divinatione</i> was written after the assassination of Caesar, that is,
  after the 15th of March in the year 44.<a name="NtA_7"></a><a
  href="#Nt_7"><sup>[7]</sup></a> Again, the Cato Maior is mentioned as a
  recent work in three letters addressed by Cicero to Atticus.<a
  name="NtA_8"></a><a href="#Nt_8"><sup>[8]</sup></a> The earliest of these
  letters was written on or about the 12th of May, 44.<a
  name="NtA_9"></a><a href="#Nt_9"><sup>[9]</sup></a> We shall hardly err,
  therefore, if we assume that Cicero composed the Cato Maior in April of
  the year 44.<a name="NtA_10"></a><a href="#Nt_10"><sup>[10]</sup></a> This
  agrees also with slight indications in the work itself. In the dedicatory
  introduction Cicero speaks of troubles weighing heavily on himself and
  Atticus.<a name="NtA_11"></a><a href="#Nt_11"><sup>[11]</sup></a> Any one
  who reads the letters to Atticus despatched in April, 44, will have
  little doubt that the troubles hinted at are the apprehensions as to the
  course of Antonius, from whom Cicero had personally something to fear.
  Atticus was using all the influence he could bring to bear on Antonius in
  order to secure Cicero's safety; <!-- Page vii --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii"></a>[vii]</span> hence Cicero's care
  to avoid in the dedication all but the vaguest possible allusions to
  politics. Had that introduction been written before Caesar's death, we
  should have had plain allusions (as in the prooemia of the
  <i>Academica</i>, the <i>De Finibus</i>, the <i>Tusculan
  Disputations</i>, and the <i>De Natura Deorum</i>) to Caesar's
  dictatorship.<a name="NtA_12"></a><a href="#Nt_12"><sup>[12]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The time was one of desperate gloom for Cicero. The downfall of the
  old constitution had overwhelmed him with sorrow, and his brief outburst
  of joy over Caesar's death had been quickly succeeded by disgust and
  alarm at the proceedings of Antonius. The deep wound caused by his
  daughter's death<a name="NtA_13"></a><a href="#Nt_13"><sup>[13]</sup></a>
  was still unhealed. It is easy to catch in the Cato Maior some echoes of
  his grief for her. When it is said that of all Cato's titles to
  admiration none is higher than the fortitude he showed in bearing the
  death of his son,<a name="NtA_14"></a><a href="#Nt_14"><sup>[14]</sup></a>
  the writer is thinking of the struggle he himself had been waging against
  a like sorrow for more than a year past; and when Cato expresses his firm
  conviction that he will meet his child beyond the grave,<a
  name="NtA_15"></a><a href="#Nt_15"><sup>[15]</sup></a> we can see Cicero's
  own yearning for reunion with his deeply loved Tullia.</p>

<p class="center">2. <i>Greek Sources.</i></p>

  <p>All Cicero's philosophical and rhetorical writings were confessedly
  founded more or less on Greek originals.<a name="NtA_16"></a><a
  href="#Nt_16"><sup>[16]</sup></a> The stores from which he principally drew
  in writing the Cato Maior are clearly indicated in several parts of the
  work. Passages from Xenophon's <i>Oeconomicus</i> are translated in
  Chapters 17 and 22. In Chapters 2 and 3 there is a close imitation of the
  conversation between Socrates and Cephalus at the beginning of Plato's
  <i>Republic</i>, while in Chapter 21 is reproduced one of the most <!--
  Page viii --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii"></a>[viii]</span>
  striking portions of the <i>Phaedo</i>, 72 E-73 B, 78-80.<a
  name="NtA_17"></a><a href="#Nt_17"><sup>[17]</sup></a> The view of the
  divine origin and destiny of the human soul contained in the passage from
  the <i>Phaedo</i> is rendered by Cicero in many of his works,<a
  name="NtA_18"></a><a href="#Nt_18"><sup>[18]</sup></a> and was held by him
  with quite a religious fervor and sincerity.</p>

  <p>Besides these instances of special indebtedness Cicero, in composing
  the Cato Maior, was no doubt under obligations of a more general kind to
  the Greeks. The form of the dialogue is Greek, and Aristotelian rather
  than Platonic.<a name="NtA_19"></a><a href="#Nt_19"><sup>[19]</sup></a> But
  further, it is highly probable that Cicero owed to some particular Greek
  dialogue on Old Age the general outline of the arguments he there brings
  forward. Many of the Greek illustrative allusions may have had the same
  origin, though in many cases Roman illustrations must have been
  substituted for Greek. Whether the dialogue by Aristo Cius, cursorily
  mentioned in the Cato Maior,<a name="NtA_20"></a><a
  href="#Nt_20"><sup>[20]</sup></a> was at all used by Cicero or not it is
  impossible to determine.<a name="NtA_21"></a><a
  href="#Nt_21"><sup>[21]</sup></a></p>

<p class="center">3. <i>Purpose.</i></p>

  <p>The Cato Maior is a popular essay in Ethics, applying the principles
  of philosophy to the alleviation of one of life's chief burdens, old age.
  In ancient times, when philosophy formed the real and only religion of
  the educated class, themes like this were deemed to afford a worthy
  employment for the pens even of the greatest philosophers. Such essays
  formed the only substitute the ancients had for our Sermons. There can be
  no doubt of Cicero's sincerity when he says that the arguments he sets
  <!-- Page ix --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix"></a>[ix]</span>
  forth in the treatise had given him real comfort,<a name="NtA_22"></a><a
  href="#Nt_22"><sup>[22]</sup></a> and the opening words of the dedication
  show that he meant and hoped to administer the same comfort to his friend
  Atticus, who indeed acknowledged the benefit he derived from the work.<a
  name="NtA_23"></a><a href="#Nt_23"><sup>[23]</sup></a> When Cicero wrote
  the treatise he was himself sixty-two years of age, while his friend was
  three years older. He speaks, therefore, rather euphemistically when he
  says that his purpose is to lighten the trouble of an old age which is
  already close at hand, or at all events approaching.<a
  name="NtA_24"></a><a href="#Nt_24"><sup>[24]</sup></a></p>

  <p>But in addition to the main ethical purpose, there was, as in many of
  Cicero's works, a distinct political purpose. He desired to stimulate in
  his readers an admiration for what he regarded as the golden age of Roman
  politics, the era of the Punic wars, and to do this by making the
  contrast between that age and his own appear as striking as possible. A
  like double purpose is apparent throughout the <i>De Re Publica</i>,
  where Africanus the younger is the chief personage, and in the treatise
  on Friendship, where Laelius is the central figure. For the dialogue on
  Old Age M. Porcius Cato the Censor is selected as the principal speaker
  for two reasons: first, because he was renowned for the vigor of mind and
  body he displayed in advanced life;<a name="NtA_25"></a><a
  href="#Nt_25"><sup>[25]</sup></a> and secondly, because in him were
  conspicuously exhibited the serious simplicity, the unswerving adherence
  to principle, and the self-sacrificing patriotism which were the ideal
  Roman virtues, and which Cicero could not find among the politicians of
  his time.</p>

<p class="center">4. <i>Form and Language.</i></p>

  <p>The Cato Maior, like most of Cicero's philosophical writings, is cast
  in the form of a dialogue. Among the ancients the dialogue <!-- Page x
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x"></a>[x]</span> was a common
  rhetorical device, especially in the presentation of abstruse subjects.
  The introduction of characters to conduct the discussion gave vividness
  and clearness to the unfolding of the argument, as well as a kind of
  dramatic interest to the production. In the Cato Maior<a
  name="NtA_26"></a><a href="#Nt_26"><sup>[26]</sup></a> and the Laelius, as
  generally, Cicero followed the plan of Aristotle's dialogues (now lost)
  rather than that of the dialogues of Plato. In the former there was more
  of exposition and less of discussion than in the latter; one person
  stated his views on some question, and the company in attendance only
  made occasional remarks without attempting to debate the question. In the
  latter, although one person, Socrates, is everywhere prominent, others
  are continually drawn into the discussions, and there is a quick
  interchange of question and answer. The Aristotelian form was better
  adapted to Cicero's purposes than the Platonic; the progress of the
  argument was less interrupted, and thus better opportunity for a
  symmetrical development of the theme was afforded. Then, too, the former
  was more popular. The style of Aristotle<a name="NtA_27"></a><a
  href="#Nt_27"><sup>[27]</sup></a> had been imitated by Theophrastus and
  many other writers down to Cicero's time, while that of Plato had found
  hardly any imitators.</p>

  <p>The editors of the Cato Maior have generally assumed that Cicero
  attempted to give an antique coloring to the diction of the dialogue in
  order to remind readers of Cato's own style. It is only necessary to read
  a page or two of Cato's <i>De Re Rustica</i> to have this illusion
  dispelled. The only things actually alleged to be archaisms are (1) the
  use of deponent participles as passives in §§ <a href="#Sect_4">4</a>, <a

<p class="center">5. <i>Personages.</i></p>

  <p>The conversation is supposed to take place between Cato, Scipio
  Africanus the younger, and Laelius, in the year before Cato's death,
  <i>i.e.</i> 150 B.C., when he was in his eighty-fourth year,<a
  name="NtA_28"></a><a href="#Nt_28"><sup>[28]</sup></a> Scipio being about
  35 and Laelius a few years older.</p>

  <p>(1.) <i>Cato.</i> M. Porcius Cato was born in 234 B.C.<a
  name="NtA_29"></a><a href="#Nt_29"><sup>[29]</sup></a> at the ancient Latin
  town of Tusculum. Little is known of his family except that it was
  plebeian, and possessed a small patrimony in the territory of the
  Sabines, close to the farm of M'. Curius Dentatus, one of Cato's great
  heroes and models. The heads of the family, so far as memory extended,
  had distinguished themselves as tough warriors and hardy farmers. Among
  the Sabines, who even down to the times of the Empire were famed for
  simplicity of manners and the practice of all the sterner virtues, Cato
  passed those portions of his life which were not occupied with business
  of state. From his earliest days he toiled in his own fields, and
  contented himself with the hardest rustic life.<a name="NtA_30"></a><a
  href="#Nt_30"><sup>[30]</sup></a> Yet even in his boyhood Cato must have
  passed intervals at Rome, and seen something of the great statesmen and
  generals of the time.<a name="NtA_31"></a><a
  href="#Nt_31"><sup>[31]</sup></a> He seems to have received when young as
  thorough an education as was possible without learning Greek, such an
  education as was to be obtained only in the capital. He grew up to
  manhood in the comparatively quiet <!-- Page xii --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii"></a>[xii]</span> period between the
  first and the second Punic wars; the most exciting event of his younger
  years must have been the destruction at Clastidium of the vast hordes of
  Celts who had swept over the northern half of Italy, almost within reach
  of Rome.</p>

  <p>Cato was of the age for military service about the time of the battle
  of Lake Trasimenus, and entered the army then as a common soldier.<a
  name="NtA_32"></a><a href="#Nt_32"><sup>[32]</sup></a> The first expedition
  in which he is definitely said to have taken part is that of Q. Fabius
  Maximus Cunctator against Hannibal in Campania, in 214.<a
  name="NtA_33"></a><a href="#Nt_33"><sup>[33]</sup></a> This Roman commander
  was a man entirely after Cato's heart, and became one of his models in
  public life.</p>

  <p>Before and during the early years of his soldier's life, Cato
  succeeded in winning some reputation as an orator, having practised first
  in the provincial courts near his home, and afterwards at Rome.<a
  name="NtA_34"></a><a href="#Nt_34"><sup>[34]</sup></a> This reputation as
  well as his great force of character procured for him a powerful
  life-long friend and patron, M. Valerius Flaccus, a statesman of the old
  Roman conservative-democratic school of politics, the leader of which was
  Fabius Cunctator. Through the influence of Flaccus, possibly with the aid
  of Fabius, Cato became military tribune, and served with that rank under
  Marcellus in Sicily, under Fabius again at the capture of Tarentum in
  209,<a name="NtA_35"></a><a href="#Nt_35"><sup>[35]</sup></a> and under C.
  Claudius Nero at the battle of the Metaurus, where he contributed
  materially to that great victory.</p>

  <p>In 204 Cato began his political career with the quaestorship.<a
  name="NtA_36"></a><a href="#Nt_36"><sup>[36]</sup></a> As he was a <i>novus
  homo</i> and a man of small private means, it was no small distinction
  that he had forced his way to office in <!-- Page xiii --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii"></a>[xiii]</span> his thirtieth year.
  The lot assigned him as quaestor to Scipio, then in Sicily and about to
  cross over into Africa. The chance was most unfortunate, if for no other
  reason, because Cato was intimately connected with the party in the
  senate opposed to Scipio, which had been attempting to bring him to trial
  for the atrocities committed by the Roman army in southern Italy. But in
  addition the two men were so utterly different that there was no
  possibility of the quaestor standing in that filial relation to his
  consul, which old Roman custom required. As financial officer, Cato
  complained of the luxury and extravagance which Scipio allowed not only
  to himself but to his army. Yet the complaint was made not so much on
  economic as on moral grounds; it seemed to Cato that the old Roman
  discipline and power to endure hardships were being swept away. The
  dispute was ended by Scipio allowing Cato to return to Rome, some
  authorities say from Sicily, others from Africa. According to one
  writer,<a name="NtA_37"></a><a href="#Nt_37"><sup>[37]</sup></a> he came
  home by way of Sardinia and brought thence with him Ennius the poet.<a
  name="NtA_38"></a><a href="#Nt_38"><sup>[38]</sup></a></p>

  <p>In 199 Cato was plebeian aedile, and exercised with severity the
  police jurisdiction pertaining to that office, yet so as to win popular
  approval, since he was chosen praetor for 198 without the usual interval.
  The province of Sardinia was entrusted to him, and he strained every
  nerve to make his government present as strong a contrast as possible
  with the lax and corrupt administration of the nobles who took Scipio for
  their pattern. The troops were sternly disciplined, and law-breakers of
  every kind severely dealt with; in money matters the strictest economy
  prevailed; all gifts from provincials to Roman officers were forbidden.
  The praetor, the great representative of Roman power, passed from town to
  town attended by a single servant.</p>

  <p>In 196 Cato was occupied with his canvass for the consulship <!-- Page
  xiv --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv"></a>[xiv]</span> of the
  year 195, to which he was elected in company with his friend Flaccus.
  Cato was the first <i>novus homo</i> elected since C. Flaminius, the
  consul of 217. It is probable, though not certain, that he paved the way
  to his election by carrying the first of the <i>leges Porciae</i>,
  restricting the right of punishing Roman citizens. During the whole of
  his career Cato showed a high sense of the importance of the individual
  <i>civis Romanus</i>.</p>

  <p>One of the first official acts of the new consul was to deliver a set
  speech to the people against a proposal to repeal the Oppian law, passed
  twenty years before, the object of which was to prevent lavish
  expenditure on dress and adornments, particularly by women. We have a
  lively report of Cato's speech from Livy's pen, partly founded on the
  speech as published by Cato himself.<a name="NtA_39"></a><a
  href="#Nt_39"><sup>[39]</sup></a> The earnest pleading in favor of simple
  manners and economy failed, after having almost caused an open
  insurrection on the part of the women.<a name="NtA_40"></a><a
  href="#Nt_40"><sup>[40]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The two new provinces in Spain, Hispania Citerior and Ulterior, were
  still in a very unsettled state. The nearer province was made a consular
  province and assigned to Cato; the praetor who governed the farther
  province was also placed under Cato's jurisdiction. Before leaving Rome
  Cato carried a law for protecting the provincials from extortion. During
  the whole of his year of office he practised with the utmost exactness
  his principles of purity, simplicity, and economy in public affairs. He
  is said to have started from his house on the journey to Spain with only
  three servants, but when he got as far as the forum, it struck him that
  such an attendance was scarcely worthy of a Roman consul; so he purchased
  two more slaves on the spot! In the same spirit, before returning he sold
  his horse that the state might not be at the expense of transporting it
  to Italy. Cato was no less careful of the revenue than of the
  expenditure. He largely increased the productiveness of the mines and
  other <!-- Page xv --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_xv"></a>[xv]</span> property belonging to the state, and all
  goods captured from the enemy were sold for the benefit of the exchequer.
  On leaving the province Cato made an unusually large gift to each
  soldier, saying that it was better for all to bring home silver than for
  a few to bring home gold. The provincials were thoroughly content with
  their ruler and ever after looked on him as their best friend. The army
  was kept in the strictest discipline. Some disorderly conduct of the
  <i>equites</i> was rebuked by Cato in a bitter harangue which he
  afterwards published. Partly by craft, partly by good leadership in the
  field, Cato broke the strength of the turbulent natives and returned to
  enjoy a well-earned triumph.<a name="NtA_41"></a><a
  href="#Nt_41"><sup>[41]</sup></a> In the same year (194) a brilliant
  triumph was celebrated by Flamininus.</p>

  <p>Scipio, probably uneasy at the great reputations quickly won by
  Flamininus and Cato, secured his second consulship for the year 194, but
  failed to achieve anything remarkable. Cato probably spent the three
  years after his return for the most part at his Sabine farm. When the war
  against Antiochus broke out, he took service along with his friend
  Flaccus on the staff of the consul Glabrio,<a name="NtA_42"></a><a
  href="#Nt_42"><sup>[42]</sup></a> and by a difficult march over the
  mountains broke in on the king's rear, and so was chiefly instrumental in
  winning the great battle of Thermopylae, by which Antiochus was driven
  out of Greece. Immediately after the battle Cato returned home with
  despatches. We have dim and uncertain information that he took the field
  once or twice again, but his career as a soldier was practically
  ended.</p>

  <p>From this time to his death, forty years later, Cato was the leading
  figure on the stage of Roman politics. In season and out of season he
  attacked abuses or innovations in speeches addressed to the senate, the
  people, or the courts. Soon after his return from Thessaly he struck a
  heavy blow at the unrepublican honor-hunting among the magistrates, of
  which the example <!-- Page xvi --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_xvi"></a>[xvi]</span> had been set by P. Scipio Africanus.
  Most provincial governors drove their subjects into war, sent lying
  despatches home about their victories, and claimed a triumph. In 190 Cato
  attacked with success the proposal to grant a triumph to Q. Minucius
  Thermus, who had already triumphed over the Spaniards as praetor, and
  after his consulship in 193 had fought against the Ligurians. Cato's next
  victim was his former commander M'. Acilius Glabrio, who came forward at
  the same time with Cato, Marcellus (a son of the captor of Syracuse), L.
  Cornelius Scipio Nasica, T. Quinctius Flamininus (the conqueror of
  Macedonia) and Cato's friend L. Valerius Flaccus, as candidate for the
  censorship of 189. Cato by his violent speeches procured the trial of
  Glabrio for appropriating the plunder captured in Thessaly, and himself
  gave evidence concerning some property which had disappeared. Glabrio
  denounced Cato as a perjurer, but yet retired from his candidature. On
  this occasion Cato and Flaccus failed, Marcellus being elected as
  plebeian and Flamininus as patrician censor.</p>

  <p>In the next year (188) Cato acted in the senate with the party which
  tried unsuccessfully to refuse the triumph to the two consuls of 189, M.
  Fulvius Nobilior and Cn. Manlius Vulso, the former of whom had gained
  none but trifling advantages over the Aetolians, while the latter had
  disgraced the Roman name by making war without authorization upon the
  Gauls of Asia Minor, and had also suffered a humiliating defeat from some
  Thracian robber bands on his homeward march. Not disheartened by ill
  success, Cato and his friends determined to strike at higher game. L.
  Scipio Asiaticus (or Asiagenus), the brother of Africanus, was asserted
  in the senate to have appropriated 3000 talents of public money when in
  command against Antiochus. Legal proceedings were taken not only against
  Asiaticus, but against Africanus, who behaved with great violence and
  arrogance. In the end Africanus withdrew to his country estate, while his
  brother was condemned to pay a heavy fine. A death-stroke had been given
  to the almost kingly authority of Africanus, who never again showed his
  face in Rome. The proceedings <!-- Page xvii --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_xvii"></a>[xvii]</span> against the Scipios seem to have begun
  in 187 and not to have been completed before 185.</p>

  <p>Nearly twenty years had passed since the conflict between Cato and
  Scipio began, and now it had ended in a complete triumph for Cato.<a
  name="NtA_43"></a><a href="#Nt_43"><sup>[43]</sup></a> But the new modes of
  which Scipio was the chief patron were too strong to be conquered, and
  Cato spent the rest of his life in fighting a hopeless battle against
  them, though he fought for a time with the strongest weapons that the
  constitution supplied. In 184 he was censor along with Flaccus, who seems
  to have allowed his colleague full liberty of action. Every portion of
  the censor's duty was carried out on the most severe and 'old Roman'
  principles. Seven senators were degraded, among them L. Flamininus, an
  ex-consul and brother of the 'liberator of the Hellenes,' for serious
  misconduct,<a name="NtA_44"></a><a href="#Nt_44"><sup>[44]</sup></a> also
  Manilius, an ex-praetor, for no worse offence than that of having kissed
  his wife in presence of his daughter. M. Furius Purpurio, who had
  actually competed with Cato for the censorship, was punished for
  diverting a public aqueduct for his private advantage. Flaccus was named
  leader of the senate in the place of Scipio Africanus, now dead.</p>

  <p>On reviewing the <i>equites</i>, Cato removed from that body L. Scipio
  and many others on various charges: this one had allowed himself to grow
  too fat for horsemanship; that had failed to groom his horse properly;
  another had neglected his farm; another again had made an untimely jest
  on the occasion of the review itself. With the ordinary citizens Cato
  dealt just as harshly. In his censorian edict he sharply reproved the
  extravagance prevalent at private feasts. All articles of luxury, such as
  slaves purchased at fancy prices, luxurious clothing, carriages, statues,
  and pictures were rendered liable to heavy taxation. In this way Cato
  revenged himself for the repeal of the Oppian law.</p>

<!-- Page xviii --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii"></a>[xviii]</span>

  <p>In looking after the property and income of the state Cato followed
  the same principles he had acted on in Spain. He reduced the expenditure
  on public works as far as possible, and took care to sell at the full
  price the right to collect the revenue. Encroachments on the property of
  the nation were severely punished.</p>

  <p>Not by acts only, but by constant speeches, full at once of grimness
  and humor, did Cato struggle against the degeneracy of his time<a
  name="NtA_45"></a><a href="#Nt_45"><sup>[45]</sup></a>. He concluded his
  period of office with a self-laudatory harangue, and assumed the title
  <i>Censorius</i>, while his statue was placed in the temple of the
  goddess Salus with an inscription affirming that he had reformed the
  Roman nation.</p>

  <p>But in a very brief time all trace of Cato's activity as censor was
  swept away, except that afforded by the numerous life-long quarrels in
  which he had involved himself<a name="NtA_46"></a><a
  href="#Nt_46"><sup>[46]</sup></a>. In less than two years one of his
  victims, Purpurio, was employed by the senate on a high political
  mission, while another, L. Flamininus, sat among the senators at the
  games in defiance of Cato's sentence. Yet Cato remained by far the most
  powerful member of the senate. Titus Flamininus, his only important
  rival, quickly passed out of notice. So far as there was any democratic
  opposition to the senatorial oligarchy, Cato was the leader of that
  opposition for the remainder of his life. But at that period no great
  political movements agitated the state within; nearly the whole interest
  of the time was centred in the foreign relations of Rome. On matters of
  foreign policy Cato offered but little opposition to the prevailing
  tendencies of the age, though on particular occasions he exercised great
  influence. But his voice was at all times loudly heard on all questions
  of morality and public order. He supported the <i>lex Furia</i> and the
  <i>lex Voconia</i>, the object of which was to prevent the dissipation of
  family property, and the <i>lex Orchia</i>, directed against extravagant
  expenditure <!-- Page xix --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_xix"></a>[xix]</span> on feasts, also the <i>lex Baebia de
  ambitu</i>, the first serious attempt to check bribery. We hear also that
  Cato bitterly attacked Lepidus, censor in 180, for erecting a permanent
  theatre in place of the movable booths before used. The building was
  actually pulled down. We are told that from time to time he denounced the
  misdoings of provincial governors. In 171 he was one of a commission of
  five for bringing to justice three ex-praetors who had practised all
  manner of corruption in Spain. Almost the last act of his life was to
  prosecute Galba for cruel misgovernment of the Lusitanians. The titles of
  Cato's speeches show that he played a great part in the deliberations of
  the senate concerning foreign affairs, but as his fighting days were over
  and he was unfitted for diplomacy, we have little explicit evidence of
  his activity in this direction. At the end of the third Macedonian war he
  successfully opposed the annexation of Macedonia. He also saved from
  destruction the Rhodians, who during the war had plainly desired the
  victory of Perseus, and in the early days, when the Roman commanders had
  ill success, had deeply wounded the whole Roman nation by an offer to
  mediate between them and the king of Macedon.</p>

  <p>Cato had all his life retained his feeling of enmity to the
  Carthaginians, whom Scipio, he thought, had treated too tenderly. In 150
  he was one of an embassy sent to Carthage, and came back filled with
  alarm at the prosperity of the city. It is said that whatever was the
  subject on which he was asked for his opinion in the senate, he always
  ended his speech with '<i>ceterum censeo delendam esse Carthaginem</i>'
  P. Scipio Nasica, the son-in-law of Africanus, and the representative of
  his policy, always shouted out the opposite opinion, thinking that the
  fear of Carthage had a salutary effect on the Roman populace at large.
  But the ideas of Cato prevailed, and a cruel policy, carried out with
  needless brutality, led to the extinction of Rome's greatest rival. Cato
  did not live to see the conclusion of the war; he died in 149, at the age
  of 84 or 85 years, having retained his mental and physical vigor to the
  last. He had two sons, one by his first wife, and one by his second wife,
  born when Cato was 80 <!-- Page xx --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_xx"></a>[xx]</span> years of age. The elder son, to whom many
  of Cato's works were addressed, died as praetor-elect, before his
  father<a name="NtA_47"></a><a href="#Nt_47"><sup>[47]</sup></a>. The other
  was grandfather of Cato Uticensis.</p>

  <p>The literary activity of the old censor was great, though his leisure
  was small.<a name="NtA_48"></a><a href="#Nt_48"><sup>[48]</sup></a> In
  Cicero's time a collection of 150 speeches was still extant. The titles
  of about 90 are still known to us, and of some we possess a few
  fragments. Cato's greatest work, however, was his <i>Origines</i>, the
  first real historical work written in Latin. His predecessors had been
  merely compilers of chronicles. The work was founded on laborious
  investigations, and comprised the history of Rome from the earliest times
  perhaps down to 150 B.C.<a name="NtA_49"></a><a
  href="#Nt_49"><sup>[49]</sup></a>, as well as notices of the history of
  other important Italian states. Further, Cato wrote of Agriculture, to
  which he was enthusiastically devoted. We still have his <i>De Re
  Rustica</i>, a collection of maxims loosely strung together. He also
  composed works on law; a sort of educational encyclopaedia for his son;
  and a collection of witty sayings,
  <span lang="el"
  title="Apophthegmata">&#x391;&#x3C0;&#x3BF;&#x3C6;&#x3B8;&#x3B5;&#x3B3;&#x3BC;&#x3B1;&#x3C4;&#x3B1;</span>,
  drawn from Greek as well as from Roman sources.</p>

  <p>Plutarch seems to have known a collected edition of the pungent and
  proverbial utterances for which the censor was famous, and for which (not
  for any knowledge of philosophy<a name="NtA_50"></a><a
  href="#Nt_50"><sup>[50]</sup></a>) he received the title of <i>sapiens</i>
  ('shrewd') which he bore at the end of his life. This edition, however,
  was not compiled by Cato himself.</p>

  <p>In view of Cicero's treatise, the Cato Maior, it is necessary to say
  something of Cato's relations with the Greeks and Greek literature. The
  ancients give us merely vague statements that he only began to learn
  Greek 'in his old age.' The expression must be liberally interpreted if,
  as seems clear, the whole of his writings showed the influence of Greek
  literature. It is certain, however, that he thoroughly detested the Greek
  nation. This hatred was shown in acts more than once. No doubt Cato was
  <!-- Page xxi --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_xxi"></a>[xxi]</span> at least a consenting party to the
  expulsion from Rome of Greek teachers in 161 B.C. When in 155 the famous
  embassy came from Athens consisting of Carneades the Academic, Critolaus
  the Peripatetic and Diogenes the Stoic, Cato was a prime mover of the
  decree by which they were removed from the city. Socrates was one of
  Cato's favorite marks for jests. And this is the man into whose mouth
  Cicero puts the utterances, but slightly veiled, of Greek wisdom!</p>

  <p>(2.) <i>Scipio</i>. P. Cornelius Scipio Africanus, the younger, was no
  blood relation of the conqueror of Hannibal, but the adopted son of his
  son. It must be remembered, however, that adoption was much more formal
  and binding, and produced much closer ties in ancient than in modern
  times.<a name="NtA_51"></a><a href="#Nt_51"><sup>[51]</sup></a> The elder
  Africanus was unfortunate in his sons. The younger of these attained to
  the praetorship in 174, but was immediately driven from the senate by the
  censors of that year on account of his disreputable life. The elder was
  an invalid, who never held any office except that of augur, and died at
  an early age. He adopted the son of L. Aemilius Paulus, the victor of
  Pydna; the adopted son bore the name Aemilianus in memory of his origin.
  Cato's son married a daughter of Paulus, so that the censor was brought
  into relationship with the Cornelii, whose most illustrious
  representative he had hated and attacked.</p>

  <p>The young Scipio was born about 185, and when scarce 17 years old
  fought with daring bravery at Pydna. While still very young he showed a
  great devotion to study, which he retained through life. He was a
  thorough partisan of the new Greek learning, and grouped around him in
  friendship all the leaders of the Hellenistic movement. Among his dearest
  friends were Polybius, the Greek statesman and historian, and later
  Panaetius, the Stoic. In 151 B.C. when the consuls found it difficult to
  enlist officers and men for service in Spain, where great defeats had
  been suffered, Scipio volunteered, and served with great distinction as
  military tribune. When the war with Carthage broke out he <!-- Page xxii
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxii"></a>[xxii]</span> held the
  same rank, and shone by comparison with his blundering superior officers.
  Coming to Rome in 148 he stood for the aedileship, but was elected consul
  for the year 147, and again for 146, when he finished the war. He is said
  to have grieved over the fate of Carthage, and to have dreaded any
  further increase of the Roman territory. In 142 Scipio was censor, and
  acted with almost Catonian severity. In 134, though not a candidate, he
  was elected to the consulship and put in command of the Roman army then
  besieging the city of Numantia in Spain. The war, of which this siege
  formed a part, had been going on for some years most disastrously for the
  Romans, but Scipio speedily brought it to a conclusion in 133. While
  before Numantia he received news of the murder of Ti. Gracchus, whose
  sister he had married and whose cousin he had become by adoption, but
  whose policy he had on the whole opposed, though he had occasionally
  coquetted with the democrats. This course cost him the favor of the
  people, and when in 131 he desired to conduct the war against
  Aristonicus, only two of the thirty-five tribes voted for his
  appointment. In 129, after a violent scene in the senate, where he had
  opposed the carrying out of Ti. Gracchus' agrarian law, he was
  triumphantly escorted home by a crowd, composed chiefly of Italians whose
  interests had been threatened by the law. Next morning he was found dead
  in his bed. Opinion as to the cause of his death was divided at the time
  and so remained. In the <i>Laelius</i> the death is assumed to have been
  from natural causes.<a name="NtA_52"></a><a
  href="#Nt_52"><sup>[52]</sup></a> Elsewhere, however, Cicero adopts the
  view of many of Scipio's friends that he was murdered by Carbo.<a
  name="NtA_53"></a><a href="#Nt_53"><sup>[53]</sup></a> Carbo afterwards
  lent color to the suspicions by putting himself to death, in order, as
  was supposed, to avoid a direct prosecution. In ancient times even C.
  Gracchus was suspected of having thus avenged his brother's death, but no
  modern scholar of any rank has countenanced the suspicion.</p>

  <p>Whether the degree of intimacy between Cato and Scipio, which Cicero
  assumes, ever existed or not, cannot be determined.<a
  name="NtA_54"></a><a href="#Nt_54"><sup>[54]</sup></a> <!-- Page xxiii
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiii"></a>[xxiii]</span> There
  was much in Scipio that would attract Cato. Unlike the elder Africanus,
  he was severe and simple in his outward life, and though a lover of Greek
  and Greeks, yet attached to all that was best in the old Roman character

  partisan of the oligarchy. Altogether, of all Romans, he most nearly
  deserved the description, '<span lang="el" title="anêr tetragônos aneu psogou">&#x3B1;&#x3BD;&#x3B7;&#x3C1;

  antiquity, and is celebrated in the <i>Laelius</i>. Laelius was an able
  speaker, writer and soldier, and devoted to Greek learning, particularly
  to the Stoic philosophy. He is with Cicero the type of a man of

  <p>Scipio declares his admiration of Cato's vigorous and happy old age.
  Cato replies that the secret lies in following the guidance of Nature (<a
  href="#Sect_4">4</a>, <a href="#Sect_5">5</a>). Laelius then asks Cato to
  point out the road to such an old age as his own (<a
  href="#Sect_6">6</a>). This the old man promises to do, but first remarks
  that the faults charged against old age are generally due to defects of
  character (<a href="#Sect_7">7</a>). Laelius suggests that prosperity
  makes Cato's declining years pleasant. Cato admits that there may be some
  truth in this, but maintains that right character alone can make old age
  tolerable (<a href="#Sect_8">8</a>, <a href="#Sect_9">9</a>).</p>

  <p>A. Introductory argument from fact. Account of celebrated old men
  whose lives till death were useful and happy ...
  <a href="#Sect_10">10</a>-<a href="#Sect_14">14</a></p>

      <blockquote>(a). Fabius Maximus ... <a href="#Sect_10">10</a>-<a href="#Sect_12">12</a><br />
      (b). Plato; (c). Isocrates; (d). Gorgias ... <a href="#Sect_13">13</a><br />
      (e). Ennius ... <a href="#Sect_14">14</a></blockquote>

  <p>B. Refutation of charges made against old age ... <a
  href="#Sect_15">15</a>-<a href="#Sect_85">85</a></p>

  <p><i>Statement of the four charges commonly made against old age</i>: it
  withdraws men from active life, it weakens the physical powers, it takes
  away capacity for enjoyment, and it involves the anticipation of death
   ... <a href="#Sect_15">15</a></p>

  <p>A. Refutation of the first charge, that old age withdraws from active
  life.</p>


      <blockquote>(a). There are employments suited to old age which
      are as necessary to the well-being of society as
      those which require greater physical powers ... <a href="#Sect_15">15</a>-<a href="#Sect_20">20</a></blockquote>

      <blockquote>(b). The special objection that old men have weak
      memories is answered by showing that this is
      due either to an original defect or to insufficient
      exercise ... <a href="#Sect_21">21</a>-<a href="#Sect_22">22</a></blockquote>

<!-- Page xxv --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxv"></a>[xxv]</span>

      <blockquote>(c). Argument from fact: instances of old men in
      public and in private life who till death were
      actively at work ... <a href="#Sect_23">23</a>-<a href="#Sect_26">26</a></blockquote>

  <p>B. Rebuttal of the second charge, that old age weakens the physical
  powers.</p>

      <blockquote>(a). Old age does not desire nor require the strength
      of youth, because it may exert influence
      through other means. Instances cited to show
      this ... <a href="#Sect_27">27</a>-<a href="#Sect_32">32</a></blockquote>

      <blockquote>(b). Temperate habits will retain a good measure
      of strength till old age (<a href="#Sect_33">33</a>, <a href="#Sect_34">34</a>); many instances
      of weakness in old age may be attributed to
      ill-health, which is common to all periods of
      life (<a href="#Sect_35">35</a>); proper care will greatly  retard decay ... <a href="#Sect_33">33</a>-<a href="#Sect_38">38</a></blockquote>

  <p>C. Refutation of the third charge, that old age takes away the
  capacity for enjoyment</p>

      <blockquote>(a). The pleasures in which youth finds its keenest
      enjoyment are in themselves bad, and old age
      is beneficent in freeing from their allurements ... <a href="#Sect_39">39</a>-<a href="#Sect_44">44</a></blockquote>

	  <blockquote>(b). Old age has pleasures far more refined and satisfying
      than those of sense ... <a href="#Sect_45">45</a>-<a href="#Sect_64">64</a><br />
      Such as, those of conversation and literature
      (<a href="#Sect_45">45</a>-<a href="#Sect_50">50</a>); especially those of agriculture (<a href="#Sect_51">51</a>-<a href="#Sect_61">61</a>);
      and lastly, the exercise of influence, which old
      age will always possess if a rightly spent youth
      has preceded ... (<a href="#Sect_62">62</a>-<a href="#Sect_64">64</a>).</blockquote>

      <blockquote>(c). The special objection that old men's tempers
      spoil their enjoyments is met by the statement
      that this is the fault of character, not of age ... <a href="#Sect_65">65</a></blockquote>

  <p>D. Refutation of the fourth charge, that old age is unhappy because it
  involves the anticipation of death.</p>

      <blockquote>(a). Since the right aim of life is to live not long
      but well, death ought not to be dreaded at any
      age ... <a href="#Sect_66">66</a>-<a href="#Sect_69">69</a></blockquote>

<!-- Page xxvi --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvi"></a>[xxvi]</span>

      <blockquote>(b). Old men, especially those of learning and culture,
      ought not to fear death ... <a href="#Sect_70">70</a>-<a href="#Sect_76">76</a><br />
      Because, that which is according to nature is
      good, and it is natural for old men to die (<a href="#Sect_70">70</a>-<a href="#Sect_73">73</a>);
      the process of dying is brief and almost painless
      (<a href="#Sect_74">74</a>); even young men and those without learning
      often set the example of despising death
      (<a href="#Sect_75">75</a>); and old age, just as the other periods
      of life, has finally its season of ripeness and
      satiety (<a href="#Sect_76">76</a>).</blockquote>

      <blockquote>(c). Death is probably the gateway to a happy immortality ... <a href="#Sect_77">77</a>-<a href="#Sect_85">85</a><br />
      Tending towards proof of this are the arguments
      stated in Plato; viz. the rapidity of the
      mind's action, its powers of memory and invention,
      its self-activity, indivisible nature and pre-existence
      (<a href="#Sect_78">78</a>); also the arguments, attributed
      to Cyrus, based upon the soul's immateriality,
      the posthumous fame of great men and the
      likeness of death to sleep (<a href="#Sect_79">79</a>-<a href="#Sect_81">81</a>); the instinctive
      belief in immortality, so strong as even to
      form an incentive for action (<a href="#Sect_82">82</a>); and, finally,
      the speaker's own longing after immortality and
      hope of union with those whom he once knew
      and loved (<a href="#Sect_83">83</a>-<a href="#Sect_85">85</a>).</blockquote>

  commune tecum est, aut iam urgentis aut certe adventantis senectutis et
  te et me ipsum levari volo: etsi te quidem id modice ac sapienter, sicut

  vellem aliquid scribere, tu occurrebas <!-- Page 2 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2"></a>[pg 2]</span> dignus eo munere, quo
  uterque nostrum communiter uteretur. Mihi quidem ita iucunda huius libri
  confectio fuit, ut non modo omnis absterserit senectutis molestias, sed
  effecerit mollem etiam et iucundam senectutem. Numquam igitur laudari
  satis digne philosophia poterit cui qui pareat omne tempus aetatis sine
  molestia possit degere. <a name="Sect_3"></a><a href="#Snot_3">3</a> Sed
  de ceteris et diximus multa et saepe dicemus: hunc librum ad te de
  senectute misimus. Omnem autem sermonem tribuimus non Tithono, ut Aristo
  Cius, parum enim esset auctoritatis in fabula, sed M. Catoni seni, quo
  maiorem auctoritatem haberet oratio: apud quem Laelium et Scipionem
  facimus admirantis, quod is tam facile senectutem ferat, eisque eum
  respondentem, qui si eruditius videbitur disputare quam consuevit ipse in
  suis libris, attribuito litteris Graecis, quarum constat eum perstudiosum
  fuisse in senectute. Sed quid opus est plura? Iam enim ipsius Catonis
  sermo explicabit nostram omnem de senectute sententiam.</p>

  <p>II. <a name="Sect_4"></a><a href="#Snot_4">4</a> SCIPIO. Saepe numero
  admirari soleo cum hoc C. Laelio cum ceterarum rerum tuam excellentem, M.
  Cato, perfectamque sapientiam, tum vel maxime quod numquam tibi
  senectutem gravem esse senserim, quae plerisque senibus sic odiosa est,
  ut onus se Aetna gravius dicant sustinere.</p>

  <p>CATO. Rem haud sane, Scipio et Laeli, difficilem admirari videmini.
  Quibus enim nihil est in ipsis opis ad bene beateque vivendum, eis omnis
  aetas gravis est: qui autem omnia bona a se ipsi petunt, eis nihil potest
  malum videri quod naturae necessitas afferat. Quo in genere est in primis
  senectus, quam ut adipiscantur omnes optant, eandem accusant adeptam:
  tanta est stultitiae inconstantia atque perversitas. Obrepere <!-- Page 3
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3"></a>[pg 3]</span> aiunt eam
  citius quam putassent. Primum quis coegit eos falsum putare? Qui enim
  citius adulescentiae senectus quam pueritiae adulescentia obrepit? Deinde
  qui minus gravis esset eis senectus, si octingentesimum annum agerent,
  quam si octogesimum? Praeterita enim aetas quamvis longa, cum
  effluxisset, nulla consolatione permulcere posset stultam senectutem. <a
  name="Sect_5"></a><a href="#Snot_5">5</a> Quocirca si sapientiam meam
  admirari soletis, quae utinam digna esset opinione vestra nostroque
  cognomine, in hoc sumus sapientes, quod naturam optimam ducem tamquam
  deum sequimur eique paremus: a qua non veri simile est, cum ceterae
  partes aetatis bene descriptae sint, extremum actum tamquam ab inerti
  poeta esse neglectum. Sed tamen necesse fuit esse aliquid extremum et,
  tamquam in arborum bacis terraeque fructibus, maturitate tempestiva quasi
  vietum et caducum, quod ferundum est molliter sapienti. Quid est enim
  aliud Gigantum modo bellare cum dis nisi naturae repugnare?</p>

  <p><a name="Sect_6"></a><a href="#Snot_6">6</a> LAELIUS. Atqui, Cato,
  gratissimum nobis, ut etiam pro Scipione pollicear, feceris, si, quoniam
  speramus, volumus quidem certe, senes fieri, multo ante a te didicerimus
  quibus facillime rationibus ingravescentem aetatem ferre possimus.</p>

  <p>CATO. Faciam vero, Laeli, praesertim si utrique vestrum, ut dicis,
  gratum futurum est.</p>

  <p>LAELIUS. Volumus sane, nisi molestum est, Cato, tamquam longam aliquam
  viam confeceris, quam nobis quoque ingrediundum sit, istuc, quo
  pervenisti, videre quale sit.</p>

  <p>III. <a name="Sect_7"></a><a href="#Snot_7">7</a> CATO. Faciam ut
  potero, Laeli. Saepe enim interfui querellis aequalium meorum, pares
  autem vetere <!-- Page 4 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_4"></a>[pg 4]</span> proverbio cum paribus facillime
  congregantur, quae C. Salinator, quae Sp. Albinus, homines consulares,
  nostri fere aequales, deplorare solebant, tum quod voluptatibus carerent,
  sine quibus vitam nullam putarent, tum quod spernerentur ab eis, a quibus
  essent coli soliti; qui mihi non id videbantur accusare, quod esset
  accusandum. Nam si id culpa senectutis accideret, eadem mihi usu venirent
  reliquisque omnibus maioribus natu, quorum ego multorum cognovi
  senectutem sine querella, qui se et libidinum vinculis laxatos esse non
  moleste ferrent nec a suis despicerentur. Sed omnium istius modi
  querellarum in moribus est culpa, non in aetate. Moderati enim et nec
  difficiles nec inhumani senes tolerabilem senectutem agunt, importunitas
  autem et inhumanitas omni aetati molesta est.</p>

  <p><a name="Sect_8"></a><a href="#Snot_8">8</a> LAELIUS. Est, ut dicis,
  Cato;  sed fortasse dixerit quispiam tibi propter opes et copias et
  dignitatem tuam tolerabiliorem senectutem videri, id autem non posse
  multis contingere.</p>

  <p>CATO. Est istuc quidem, Laeli, aliquid, sed nequaquam in isto sunt
  omnia; ut Themistocles fertur Seriphio cuidam in iurgio respondisse, cum
  ille dixisset non eum sua, sed patriae gloria splendorem assecutum: 'nec
  hercule', inquit, 'si ego Seriphius essem, nec tu, si Atheniensis, clarus
  umquam fuisses'. Quod eodem modo de senectute dici potest; nec enim in
  summa inopia levis esse senectus potest, ne sapienti quidem, nec
  insipienti etiam in summa copia non gravis. <a name="Sect_9"></a><a
  href="#Snot_9">9</a> Aptissima omnino sunt, Scipio et Laeli, arma
  senectutis artes exercitationesque virtutum, quae in omni aetate cultae,
  cum diu multumque vixeris, mirificos ecferunt fructus, non solum quia
  numquam deserunt, ne extremo quidem <!-- Page 5 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5"></a>[pg 5]</span> tempore aetatis,
  quamquam id quidem maximum est, verum etiam quia conscientia bene actae
  vitae multorumque bene factorum recordatio iucundissima est.</p>

  <p>IV. <a name="Sect_10"></a><a href="#Snot_10">10</a> Ego Q. Maximum,
  eum qui Tarentum recepit, senem adulescens ita dilexi, ut aequalem. Erat
  enim in illo viro comitate condita gravitas, nec senectus mores
  mutaverat. Quamquam eum colere coepi non admodum grandem natu, sed tamen
  iam aetate provectum. Anno enim post consul primum fuerat quam ego natus
  sum, cumque eo quartum consule adulescentulus miles ad Capuam profectus
  sum quintoque anno post ad Tarentum. Quaestor deinde quadriennio post
  factus sum, quem magistratum gessi consulibus Tuditano et Cethego, cum
  quidem ille admodum senex suasor legis Cinciae de donis et muneribus
  fuit. Hic et bella gerebat ut adulescens, cum plane grandis esset, et
  Hannibalem iuveniliter exsultantem patientia sua molliebat; de quo
  praeclare familiaris noster Ennius:</p>

      <p><i>noenum rumores ponebat ante salutem;</i></p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p><a name="Sect_11"></a><a href="#Snot_11">11</a> Tarentum vero qua
  vigilantia, quo consilio recepit! Cum quidem me audiente Salinatori, qui
  amisso oppido fugerat in arcem, glorianti atque ita dicenti, 'mea opera,
  Q. Fabi, Tarentum recepisti', 'certe', inquit ridens, 'nam nisi tu
  amisisses, numquam recepissem'. Nec vero in armis praestantior quam in
  toga; qui consul iterum, Sp. Carvilio collega quiescente, C. Flaminio
  tribuno plebis, quoad potuit, restitit agrum Picentem et Gallicum viritim
  contra senatus auctoritatem dividenti, <!-- Page 6 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6"></a>[pg 6]</span> augurque cum esset,
  dicere ausus est optimis auspiciis ea geri, quae pro rei publicae salute
  gererentur; quae contra rem publicam ferrentur, contra auspicia ferri. <a
  name="Sect_12"></a><a href="#Snot_12">12</a> Multa in eo viro praeclara
  cognovi, sed nihil admirabilius quam quo modo ille mortem fili tulit,
  clari viri et consularis. Est in manibus laudatio, quam cum legimus, quem
  philosophum non contemnimus? Nec vero ille in luce modo atque in oculis
  civium magnus, sed intus domique praestantior. Qui sermo, quae praecepta!
  Quanta notitia antiquitatis, scientia iuris auguri! Multae etiam, ut in
  homine Romano, litterae: omnia memoria tenebat non domestica solum, sed
  etiam externa bella. Cuius sermone ita tum cupide fruebar, quasi iam
  divinarem, id quod evenit, illo exstincto fore unde discerem neminem.</p>

  <p>V. <a name="Sect_13"></a><a href="#Snot_13">13</a> Quorsus igitur haec
  tam multa de Maximo? Quia profecto videtis nefas esse dictu miseram
  fuisse talem senectutem. Nec tamen omnes possunt esse Scipiones aut
  Maximi, ut urbium expugnationes, ut pedestris navalisve pugnas, ut bella
  a se gesta, ut triumphos recordentur. Est etiam quiete et pure atque
  eleganter actae aetatis placida ac lenis senectus, qualem accepimus
  Platonis, qui uno et octogesimo anno scribens est mortuus, qualem
  Isocrati, qui eum librum, qui Panathenaicus inscribitur, quarto
  nonagesimo anno scripsisse dicit vixitque quinquennium postea; cuius
  magister Leontinus Gorgias centum et septem complevit annos, neque umquam
  in suo studio atque opere cessavit. Qui, cum ex eo quaereretur cur tam
  diu vellet esse in vita, 'nihil habeo,' inquit, 'quod accusem
  senectutem'. Praeclarum responsum et docto homine dignum! <a

  </div>

  <p>Equi fortis et victoris senectuti comparat suam; quem quidem probe
  meminisse potestis; anno enim undevicesimo post eius mortem hi consules,
  T. Flamininus et M'. Acilius, facti sunt; ille autem Caepione et Philippo
  iterum consulibus mortuus est, cum ego quinque et sexaginta annos natus
  legem Voconiam magna voce et bonis lateribus suasissem. Annos septuaginta
  natus, tot enim vixit Ennius, ita ferebat duo quae maxima putantur,
  onera, paupertatem et senectutem, ut eis paene delectari videretur.</p>

  <p><a name="Sect_15"></a><a href="#Snot_15">15</a> Etenim, cum complector
  animo, quattuor reperio causas cur senectus misera videatur: unam, quod

  quod privet omnibus fere voluptatibus; quartam, quod haud procul absit a

  Maximus, nihil L. Paulus, pater tuus, socer optimi viri fili mei? Ceteri

  <p>ceteraque gravissime, notum enim vobis carmen est, et tamen ipsius
  Appi exstat oratio. Atque haec ille egit septemdecim annis post alterum
  consulatum, cum inter duos consulatus anni decem interfuissent censorque
  ante superiorem consulatum fuisset, ex quo intellegitur Pyrrhi bello
  grandem sane fuisse, et tamen sic a patribus accepimus. <a

  meminerunt! Manent ingenia senibus, modo permaneat studium et industria,
  neque ea solum claris et honoratis viris, sed in vita etiam privata et

  studium cum rem neglegere familiarem videretur, a filiis in iudicium
  vocatus est, ut, quem ad modum nostro more male rem gerentibus patribus
  bonis interdici solet, sic illum quasi desipientem a re familiari
  removerent iudices. Tum senex dicitur eam fabulam quam in manibus habebat
  et proxime scripserat, Oedipum Coloneum, recitasse iudicibus quaesisseque

  <p>Et multa fortasse quae volt, atque in ea, quae non volt, saepe etiam

  <p><a name="Sect_26"></a><a href="#Snot_26">26</a> Iucundum potius quam

  delectantur, leviorque fit senectus eorum qui a iuventute coluntur et
  diliguntur, sic adulescentes senum praeceptis gaudent, quibus ad virtutum
  studia ducuntur, nec minus intellego me vobis quam mihi vos esse
  iucundos. Sed videtis, ut senectus non modo languida atque iners non sit,
  verum etiam sit operosa et semper agens aliquid et moliens, tale
  scilicet, quale cuiusque studium in superiore vita fuit. Quid, qui etiam
  addiscunt aliquid, ut et Solonem versibus gloriantem videmus, qui se
  cotidie aliquid addiscentem dicit senem fieri, et ego feci, qui litteras
  Graecas senex didici, quas quidem sic avide arripui quasi diuturnam sitim

  etiam illud, discebant enim fidibus antiqui, sed in litteris certe
  elaboravi.</p>

<!-- Page 12 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12"></a>[pg 12]</span>

  <p>IX. <a name="Sect_27"></a><a href="#Snot_27">27</a> Ne nunc quidem
  viris desidero adulescentis, is enim erat locus alter de vitiis
  senectutis, non plus quam adulescens tauri aut elephanti desiderabam.
  Quod est, eo decet uti et quidquid agas agere pro viribus. Quae enim vox
  potest esse contemptior quam Milonis Crotoniatae? Qui cum iam senex esset
  athletasque se exercentis in curriculo videret, aspexisse lacertos suos
  dicitur illacrimansque dixisse, 'at hi quidem mortui iam sunt'. Non vero
  tam isti, quam tu ipse, nugator, neque enim ex te umquam es nobilitatus,
  sed ex lateribus et lacertis tuis. Nihil Sex. Aelius tale, nihil multis
  annis ante Ti. Coruncanius, nihil modo P. Crassus, a quibus iura civibus
  praescribebantur, quorum usque ad extremum spiritum est provecta
  prudentia. <a name="Sect_28"></a><a href="#Snot_28">28</a> Orator metuo
  ne languescat senectute: est enim munus eius non ingeni solum, sed
  laterum etiam et virium. Omnino canorum illud in voce splendescit etiam
  nescio quo pacto in senectute, quod equidem adhuc non amisi, et videtis
  annos. Sed tamen est decorus seni sermo quietus et remissus, facitque
  persaepe ipsa sibi audientiam diserti senis composita et mitis oratio,
  quam si ipse exsequi nequeas, possis tamen Scipioni praecipere et Laelio.
  Quid enim est iucundius senectute stipata studiis iuventutis? <a
  name="Sect_29"></a><a href="#Snot_29">29</a> An ne illas quidem viris
  senectuti relinquimus, ut adulescentis doceat, instituat, ad omne offici
  munus instruat? Quo quidem opere quid potest esse praeclarius? Mihi vero
  et Cn. et P. Scipiones et avi tui duo L. Aemilius et P. Africanus
  comitatu nobilium iuvenum fortunati videbantur, nec ulli bonarum artium
  magistri non beati putandi, quamvis consenuerint vires atque defecerint.
  Etsi ipsa ista defectio virium adulescentiae vitiis efficitur saepius
  quam senectute; libidinosa enim et intemperans adulescentia <!-- Page 13
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13"></a>[pg 13]</span> effetum
  corpus tradit senectuti. <a name="Sect_30"></a><a href="#Snot_30">30</a>
  Cyrus quidem apud Xenophontem eo sermone, quem moriens habuit, cum
  admodum senex esset, negat se umquam sensisse senectutem suam
  imbecilliorem factam quam adulescentia fuisset. Ego L. Metellum memini
  puer, qui, cum quadriennio post alterum consulatum pontifex maximus
  factus esset, viginti et duos annos ei sacerdotio praefuit, ita bonis
  esse viribus extremo tempore aetatis, ut adulescentiam non requireret.
  Nihil necesse est mihi de me ipso dicere, quamquam est id quidem senile
  aetatique nostrae conceditur. X. <a name="Sect_31"></a><a
  href="#Snot_31">31</a> Videtisne, ut apud Homerum saepissime Nestor de
  virtutibus suis praedicet? Tertiam enim aetatem hominum videbat, nec erat
  ei verendum ne vera praedicans de se nimis videretur aut insolens aut
  loquax. Etenim, ut ait Homerus, ex eius lingua melle dulcior fluebat
  oratio; quam ad suavitatem nullis egebat corporis viribus. Et tamen dux
  ille Graeciae nusquam optat ut Aiacis similis habeat decem, sed ut
  Nestoris, quod si sibi acciderit, non dubitat quin brevi sit Troia
  peritura. <a name="Sect_32"></a><a href="#Snot_32">32</a> Sed redeo ad
  me. Quartum ago annum et octogesimum: vellem equidem idem posse gloriari
  quod Cyrus, sed tamen hoc queo dicere, non me quidem eis esse viribus,
  quibus aut miles bello Punico aut quaestor eodem bello aut consul in
  Hispania fuerim aut quadriennio post, cum tribunus militaris depugnavi
  apud Thermopylas M'. Glabrione consule; sed tamen, ut vos videtis, non
  plane me enervavit, non afflixit senectus: non curia viris meas
  desiderat, non rostra, non amici, non clientes, non hospites. Nec enim
  umquam sum assensus veteri illi laudatoque proverbio, quod monet mature
  fieri senem, si diu velis senex esse. Ego vero me minus diu senem esse
  mallem quam esse <!-- Page 14 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_14"></a>[pg 14]</span> senem ante quam essem. Itaque nemo
  adhuc convenire me voluit cui fuerim occupatus. <a name="Sect_33"></a><a
  href="#Snot_33">33</a> At minus habeo virium quam vestrum utervis. Ne vos
  quidem T. Ponti centurionis viris habetis: num idcirco est ille
  praestantior? Moderatio modo virium adsit et tantum quantum potest
  quisque nitatur, ne ille non magno desiderio tenebitur virium. Olympiae
  per stadium ingressus esse Milo dicitur, cum umeris sustineret bovem:
  utrum igitur has corporis an Pythagorae tibi malis viris ingeni dari?
  Denique isto bono utare, dum adsit, cum absit, ne requiras: nisi forte
  adulescentes pueritiam, paulum aetate progressi adulescentiam debent
  requirere. Cursus est certus aetatis et una via naturae eaque simplex,
  suaque cuique parti aetatis tempestivitas est data, ut et infirmitas
  puerorum et ferocitas iuvenum et gravitas iam constantis aetatis et
  senectutis maturitas naturale quiddam habet, quod suo tempore percipi
  debeat. <a name="Sect_34"></a><a href="#Snot_34">34</a> Audire te
  arbitror, Scipio, hospes tuus avitus Masinissa quae faciat hodie
  nonaginta natus annos: cum ingressus iter pedibus sit, in equum omnino
  non ascendere; cum autem equo, ex equo non descendere; nullo imbri, nullo
  frigore adduci ut capite operto sit; summam esse in eo corporis
  siccitatem, itaque omnia exsequi regis officia et munera. Potest igitur
  exercitatio et temperantia etiam in senectute conservare aliquid pristini
  roboris.</p>

  <p>XI. Ne sint in senectute vires: ne postulantur quidem vires a
  senectute. Ergo et legibus et institutis vacat aetas nostra muneribus eis
  quae non possunt sine viribus sustineri. Itaque non modo quod non
  possumus, sed ne quantum possumus quidem cogimur. <a
  name="Sect_35"></a><a href="#Snot_35">35</a> At multi ita sunt imbecilli
  senes, ut nullum offici aut <!-- Page 15 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_15"></a>[pg 15]</span> omnino vitae munus exsequi possint. At
  id quidem non proprium senectutis vitium est, sed commune valetudinis.
  Quam fuit imbecillus P. Africani filius, is qui te adoptavit, quam tenui
  aut nulla potius valetudine! Quod ni ita fuisset, alterum illud
  exstitisset lumen civitatis; ad paternam enim magnitudinem animi doctrina
  uberior accesserat. Quid mirum igitur in senibus, si infirmi sunt
  aliquando, cum id ne adulescentes quidem effugere possint? Resistendum,
  Laeli et Scipio, senectuti est, eiusque vitia diligentia compensanda
  sunt, pugnandum tamquam contra morbum sic contra senectutem, <a
  name="Sect_36"></a><a href="#Snot_36">36</a> habenda ratio valetudinis,
  utendum exercitationibus modicis, tantum cibi et potionis adhibendum, ut
  reficiantur vires, non opprimantur. Nec vero corpori solum subveniendum
  est, sed menti atque animo multo magis. Nam haec quoque, nisi tamquam
  lumini oleum instilles, exstinguuntur senectute. Et corpora quidem
  exercitationum defetigatione ingravescunt, animi autem exercitando
  levantur. Nam quos ait Caecilius 'comicos stultos senes,' hos significat
  credulos obliviosos dissolutos, quae vitia sunt non senectutis, sed
  inertis ignavae somniculosae senectutis. Ut petulantia, ut libido magis
  est adulescentium quam senum, nec tamen omnium adulescentium, sed non
  proborum, sic ista senilis stultitia, quae deliratio appellari solet,
  senum levium est, non omnium. <a name="Sect_37"></a><a
  href="#Snot_37">37</a> Quattuor robustos filios, quinque filias, tantam
  domum, tantas clientelas Appius regebat et caecus et senex; intentum enim
  animum tamquam arcum habebat nec languescens succumbebat senectuti.
  Tenebat non modo auctoritatem, sed etiam imperium in suos: metuebant
  servi, verebantur liberi, carum omnes habebant; vigebat in illo animus
  patrius <!-- Page 16 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16"></a>[pg
  16]</span> et disciplina. <a name="Sect_38"></a><a href="#Snot_38">38</a>
  Ita enim senectus honesta est, si se ipsa defendit, si ius suum retinet,
  si nemini emancipata est, si usque ad ultimum spiritum dominatur in suos.
  Ut enim adulescentem in quo est senile aliquid, sic senem in quo est
  aliquid adulescentis probo, quod qui sequitur, corpore senex esse
  poterit, animo numquam erit. Septimus mihi liber Originum est in manibus;
  ommia antiquitatis monumenta colligo; causarum illustrium, quascunque
  defendi, nunc cum maxime conficio orationes; ius augurium pontificium
  civile tracto; multum etiam Graecis litteris utor, Pythagoriorumque more,
  exercendae memoriae gratia, quid quoque die dixerim audierim egerim
  commemoro vesperi. Hae sunt exercitationes ingeni, haec curricula mentis;
  in his desudans atque elaborans corporis viris non magno opere desidero.
  Adsum amicis, venio in senatum frequens ultroque affero res multum et diu
  cogitatas easque tueor animi, non corporis viribus. Quas si exsequi
  nequirem, tamen me lectulus meus oblectaret ea ipsa cogitantem, quae iam
  agere non possem; sed ut possim facit acta vita. Semper enim in his
  studiis laboribusque viventi non intellegitur quando obrepat senectus:
  ita sensim sine sensu aetas senescit nec subito frangitur, sed
  diuturnitate exstinguitur.</p>

  <p>XII. <a name="Sect_39"></a><a href="#Snot_39">39</a> Sequitur tertia
  vituperatio senectutis, quod eam carere dicunt voluptatibus. O praeclarum
  munus aetatis, si quidem id aufert a nobis, quod est in adulescentia
  vitiosissimum! Accipite enim, optimi adulescentes, veterem orationem
  Archytae Tarentini, magni in primis et praeclari viri, quae mihi tradita
  est cum essem adulescens Tarenti cum Q. Maximo. Nullam capitaliorem
  pestem quam voluptatem corporis hominibus <!-- Page 17 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17"></a>[pg 17]</span> dicebat a natura
  datam, cuius voluptatis avidae libidines temere et ecfrenate ad potiendum
  incitarentur. Hinc patriae proditiones, <a name="Sect_40"></a><a
  href="#Snot_40">40</a> hinc rerum publicarum eversiones, hinc cum
  hostibus clandestina colloquia nasci; nullum denique scelus, nullum malum
  facinus esse ad quod suscipiendum non libido voluptatis impelleret;
  stupra vero et adulteria et omne tale flagitium nullis excitari aliis
  illecebris nisi voluptatis; cumque homini sive natura sive quis deus
  nihil mente praestabilius dedisset, huic divino muneri ac dono nihil tam
  esse inimicum quam voluptatem. <a name="Sect_41"></a><a
  href="#Snot_41">41</a> Nec enim libidine dominante temperantiae locum
  esse, neque omnino in voluptatis regno virtutem posse consistere. Quod
  quo magis intellegi posset, fingere animo iubebat tanta incitatum aliquem
  voluptate corporis, quanta percipi posset maxima: nemini censebat fore
  dubium quin tam diu, dum ita gauderet, nihil agitare mente, nihil
  ratione, nihil cogitatione consequi posset. Quocirca nihil esse tam
  detestabile tamque pestiferum quam voluptatem, si quidem ea, cum maior
  esset atque longior, omne animi lumen exstingueret. Haec cum C. Pontio
  Samnite, patre eius, a quo Caudino proelio Sp. Postumius T. Veturius
  consules superati sunt, locutum Archytam Nearchus Tarentinus hospes
  noster, qui in amicitia populi Romani permanserat, se a maioribus natu
  accepisse dicebat, cum quidem ei sermoni interfuisset Plato Atheniensis,
  quem Tarentum venisse L. Camillo Ap. Claudio consulibus reperio. <a
  name="Sect_42"></a><a href="#Snot_42">42</a> Quorsus hoc? Ut
  intellegeretis, si voluptatem aspernari ratione et sapientia non
  possemus, magnam esse habendam senectuti gratiam, quae efficeret ut id
  non liberet quod non oporteret. Impedit enim consilium voluptas, rationi
  inimica est, mentis ut <!-- Page 18 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_18"></a>[pg 18]</span> ita dicam praestringit oculos, nec
  habet ullum cum virtute commercium. Invitus feci ut fortissimi viri T.
  Flaminini fratrem L. Flamininum e senatu eicerem septem annis post quam
  consul fuisset, sed notandam putavi libidinem. Ille enim cum esset consul
  in Gallia exoratus in convivio a scorto est ut securi feriret aliquem
  eorum qui in vinculis essent, damnati rei capitalis. Hic Tito fratre suo
  censore, qui proximus ante me fuerat, elapsus est, mihi vero et Flacco
  neutiquam probari potuit tam flagitiosa et tam perdita libido, quae cum
  probro privato coniungeret imperi dedecus.</p>

  <p>XIII. <a name="Sect_43"></a><a href="#Snot_43">43</a> Saepe audivi e
  maioribus natu, qui se porro pueros a senibus audisse dicebant, mirari
  solitum C. Fabricium quod, cum apud regem Pyrrhum legatus esset, audisset
  a Thessalo Cinea esse quendam Athenis qui se sapientem profiteretur,
  eumque dicere omnia quae faceremus ad voluptatem esse referenda. Quod ex
  eo audientis M'. Curium et Ti. Coruncanium optare solitos ut id
  Samnitibus ipsique Pyrrho persuaderetur, quo facilius vinci possent cum
  se voluptatibus dedissent. Vixerat M'. Curius cum P. Decio, qui
  quinquennio ante eum consulem se pro re publica quarto consulatu
  devoverat: norat eundem Fabricius, norat Coruncanius, qui cum ex sua vita
  tum ex eius quem dico. Deci facto iudicabant esse profecto aliquid natura
  pulchrum atque praeclarum, quod sua sponte expeteretur quodque spreta et
  contempta voluptate optimus quisque sequeretur. <a name="Sect_44"></a><a
  href="#Snot_44">44</a> Quorsum igitur tam multa de voluptate? Quia non
  modo vituperatio nulla, sed etiam summa laus senectutis est, quod ea
  voluptates nullas magno opere desiderat. Caret epulis exstructisque
  mensis et frequentibus poculis. Caret ergo etiam vinulentia et <!-- Page
  19 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19"></a>[pg 19]</span>
  cruditate et insomniis. Sed si aliquid dandum est voluptati, quoniam eius
  blanditiis non facile obsistimus, divine enim Plato escam malorum
  appellat voluptatem quod ea videlicet homines capiantur ut pisces,
  quamquam immoderatis epulis caret senectus, modicis tamen conviviis
  delectari potest. C. Duellium M. F., qui Poenos classe primus devicerat,
  redeuntem a cena senem saepe videbam puer; delectabatur cereo funali et
  tibicine, quae sibi nullo exemplo privatus sumpserat: tantum licentiae
  dabat gloria. <a name="Sect_45"></a><a href="#Snot_45">45</a> Sed quid
  ego alios? Ad me ipsum iam revertar. Primum habui semper
  sodalis&mdash;sodalitates autem me quaestore constitutae sunt sacris
  Idaeis Magnae Matris acceptis&mdash;epulabar igitur cum sodalibus, omnino
  modice, sed erat quidam fervor aetatis, qua progrediente omnia fiunt in
  dies mitiora. Neque enim ipsorum conviviorum delectationem voluptatibus
  corporis magis quam coetu amicorum et sermonibus metiebar; bene enim
  maiores accubitionem epularem amicorum, quia vitae coniunctionem haberet,
  convivium nominaverunt, melius quam Graeci, qui hoc idem tum
  compotationem, tum concenationem vocant, ut, quod in eo genere minimum
  est, id maxime probare videantur.</p>

  <p>XIV. <a name="Sect_46"></a><a href="#Snot_46">46</a> Ego vero propter
  sermonis delectationem tempestivis quoque conviviis delector, nec cum
  aequalibus solum, qui pauci admodum restant, sed cum vestra etiam aetate
  atque vobiscum, habeoque senectuti magnam gratiam, quae mihi sermonis
  aviditatem auxit, potionis et cibi sustulit. Quod si quem etiam ista
  delectant, ne omnino bellum indixisse videar voluptati, cuius est
  fortasse quidam naturalis modus, non intellego ne in istis quidem ipsis
  voluptatibus carere sensu senectutem. <!-- Page 20 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20"></a>[pg 20]</span> Me vero et
  magisteria delectant a maioribus instituta et is sermo, qui more maiorum
  a summo adhibetur in poculo, et pocula sicut in Symposio Xenophontis est,
  minuta atque rorantia, et refrigeratio aestate et vicissim aut sol aut
  ignis hibernus. Quae quidem etiam in Sabinis persequi soleo conviviumque
  vicinorum cotidie compleo, quod ad multam noctem quam maxime possumus
  vario sermone producimus. <a name="Sect_47"></a><a href="#Snot_47">47</a>
  At non est voluptatum tanta quasi titillatio in senibus. Credo, sed ne
  desideratio quidem; nihil autem est molestum quod non desideres. Bene
  Sophocles, cum ex eo quidam iam affecto aetate quaereret, utereturne
  rebus veneriis, 'di meliora!' inquit; 'ego vero istinc sicut a domino
  agresti ac furioso profugi.' Cupidis enim rerum talium odiosum fortasse
  et molestum est carere, satiatis vero et expletis iucundius est carere
  quam frui; quamquam non caret is, qui non desiderat; ergo hoc non
  desiderare dico esse iucundius. <a name="Sect_48"></a><a
  href="#Snot_48">48</a> Quod si istis ipsis voluptatibus bona aetas
  fruitur libentius, primum parvulis fruitur rebus, ut diximus, deinde eis,
  quibus senectus, etiam si non abunde potitur, non omnino caret. Ut
  Turpione Ambivio magis delectatur qui in prima cavea spectat, delectatur
  tamen etiam qui in ultima, sic adulescentia voluptates propter intuens
  magis fortasse laetatur, sed delectatur etiam senectus, procul eas
  spectans, tantum quantum sat est. <a name="Sect_49"></a><a
  href="#Snot_49">49</a> At illa quanti sunt, animum tamquam emeritis
  stipendiis libidinis ambitionis, contentionum inimicitiarum, cupiditatum
  omnium secum esse secumque, ut dicitur, vivere! Si vero habet aliquod
  tamquam pabulum studi atque doctrinae, nihil est otiosa senectute
  iucundius. Videbamus in studio dimetiendi paene caeli atque terrae Gallum
  familiarem <!-- Page 21 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_21"></a>[pg 21]</span> patris tui, Scipio. Quotiens ilium lux
  noctu aliquid describere ingressum, quotiens nox oppressit cum mane
  coepisset! Quam delectabat eum defectiones solis et lunae multo ante
  nobis praedicere! <a name="Sect_50"></a><a href="#Snot_50">50</a> Quid in
  levioribus studiis, sed tamen acutis? Quam gaudebat Bello suo Punico
  Naevius, quam Truculento Plautus, quam Pseudolo! Vidi etiam senem Livium,
  qui, cum sex annis ante quam ego natus sum fabulam docuisset Centone
  Tuditanoque consulibus, usque ad adulescentiam meam processit aetate.
  Quid de P. Licini Crassi et pontifici et civilis iuris studio loquar aut
  de huius P. Scipionis, qui his paucis diebus pontifex maximus factus est?
  Atque eos omnis, quos commemoravi, his studiis flagrantis senes vidimus.
  M. vero Cethegum, quem recte suadae medullam dixit Ennius, quanto studio
  exerceri in dicendo videbamus etiam senem! Quae sunt igitur epularum aut
  ludorum aut scortorum voluptates cum his voluptatibus comparandae? Atque
  haec quidem studia doctrinae, quae quidem prudentibus et bene institutis
  pariter cum aetate crescunt, ut honestum illud Solonis sit, quod ait
  versiculo quodam, ut ante dixi, senescere se multa in dies addiscentem,
  qua voluptate animi nulla certe potest esse maior.</p>

  <p>XV. <a name="Sect_51"></a><a href="#Snot_51">51</a> Venio nunc ad
  voluptates agricolarum, quibus ego incredibiliter delector, quae nec ulla
  impediuntur senectute et mihi ad sapientis vitam proxime videntur
  accedere. Habent enim rationem cum terra, quae numquam recusat imperium
  nec umquam sine usura reddit quod accepit, sed alias minore, plerumque
  maiore cum faenore; quamquam me quidem non fructus modo, sed etiam ipsius
  terrae vis ac natura delectat. Quae cum gremio mollito ac subacto sparsum
  semen excepit, <!-- Page 22 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_22"></a>[pg 22]</span> primum id occaecatum cohibet, ex quo
  occatio quae hoc efficit nominata est; deinde tepefactum vapore et
  compressu suo diffundit et elicit herbescentem ex eo viriditatem, quae
  nixa fibris stirpium sensim adolescit culmoque erecta geniculato vaginis
  iam quasi pubescens includitur; e quibus cum emersit, fundit frugem spici
  ordine structam et contra avium minorum morsus munitur vallo aristarum.
  <a name="Sect_52"></a><a href="#Snot_52">52</a> Quid ego vitium ortus
  satus incrementa commemorem? Satiari delectatione non possum, ut meae
  senectutis requietem oblectamentumque noscatis. Omitto enim vim ipsam
  omnium quae generantur e terra, quae ex fici tantulo grano aut ex acini
  vinaceo aut ex ceterarum frugum aut stirpium minutissimis seminibus
  tantos truncos ramosque procreet; malleoli plantae sarmenta viviradices
  propagines nonne efficiunt ut quemvis cum admiratione delectent? Vitis
  quidem quae natura caduca est et, nisi fulta est, fertur ad terram,
  eadem, ut se erigat, claviculis suis quasi manibus quidquid est nacta
  complectitur, quam serpentem multiplici lapsu et erratico, ferro amputans
  coercet ars agricolarum, ne silvescat sarmentis et in omnis partis nimia
  fundatur. <a name="Sect_53"></a><a href="#Snot_53">53</a> Itaque ineunte
  vere in eis quae relicta sunt exsistit tamquam ad articulos sarmentorum
  ea quae gemma dicitur, a qua oriens uva se ostendit, quae et suco terrae
  et calore solis augescens primo est peracerba gustatu, dein maturata
  dulcescit vestitaque pampinis nec modico tepore caret et nimios solis
  defendit ardores: qua quid potest esse cum fructu laetius, tum aspectu
  pulchrius? Cuius quidem non utilitas me solum, ut ante dixi, sed etiam
  cultura et natura ipsa delectat: adminiculorum ordines, capitum iugatio,
  religatio et propagatio vitium, sarmentorum ea, <!-- Page 23 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23"></a>[pg 23]</span> quam dixi, aliorum
  amputatio, aliorum immissio. Quid ego irrigationes, quid fossiones agri
  repastinationesque proferam quibus fit multo terra fecundior? <a
  name="Sect_54"></a><a href="#Snot_54">54</a> Quid de utilitate loquar
  stercorandi? Dixi in eo libro, quem de rebus rusticis scripsi. De qua
  doctus Hesiodus ne verbum quidem fecit, cum de cultura agri scriberet. At
  Homerus, qui multis, ut mihi videtur, ante saeculis fuit, Laerten
  lenientem desiderium, quod capiebat e filio, colentem agrum et eum
  stercorantem facit. Nec vero segetibus solum et pratis et vineis et
  arbustis res rusticae laetae sunt, sed hortis etiam et pomariis, tum
  pecudum pastu, apium examinibus, florum omnium varietate. Nec consitiones
  modo delectant, sed etiam insitiones, quibus nihil invenit agri cultura
  sollertius.</p>

  <p>XVI. <a name="Sect_55"></a><a href="#Snot_55">55</a> Possum persequi
  permulta oblectamenta rerum rusticarum, sed ea ipsa quae dixi sentio
  fuisse longiora. Ignoscetis autem, nam et studio rerum rusticarum
  provectus sum, et senectus est natura loquacior, ne ab omnibus eam vitiis
  videar vindicare. Ergo in hac vita M'. Curius, cum de Samnitibus, de
  Sabinis, de Pyrrho triumphavisset, consumpsit extremum tempus aetatis;
  cuius quidem ego villam contemplans, abest enim non longe a me, admirari
  satis non possum vel hominis ipsius continentiam vel temporum
  disciplinam. Curio ad focum sedenti magnum auri pondus Samnites cum
  attulissent, repudiati sunt; non enim aurum habere praeclarum sibi videri
  dixit, sed eis qui haberent aurum imperare. <a name="Sect_56"></a><a
  href="#Snot_56">56</a> Poteratne tantus animus efficere non iucundam
  senectutem? Sed venio ad agricolas, ne a me ipso recedam. In agris erant
  tum senatores, id est senes, si quidem aranti L. Quinctio Cincinnato
  nuntiatum est eum dictatorem esse factum, cuius dictatoris <!-- Page 24
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24"></a>[pg 24]</span> iussu
  magister equitum C. Servilius Ahala Sp. Maelium regnum appetentem
  occupatum interemit. A villa in senatum arcessebatur et Curius et ceteri
  senes, ex quo qui eos arcessebant viatores nominati sunt. Num igitur
  horum senectus miserabilis fuit, qui se agri cultione oblectabant? Mea
  quidem sententia haud scio an nulla beatior possit esse, neque solum
  officio, quod hominum generi universo cultura agrorum est salutaris, sed
  et delectatione quam dixi, et saturitate copiaque rerum omnium, quae ad
  victum hominum, ad cultum etiam deorum pertinent, ut, quoniam haec quidam
  desiderant, in gratiam iam cum voluptate redeamus. Semper enim boni
  assiduique domini referta cella vinaria, olearia, etiam penaria est,
  villaque tota locuples est, abundat porco haedo agno gallina, lacte caseo
  melle. Iam hortum ipsi agricolae succidiam alteram appellant. Conditiora
  facit haec supervacaneis etiam operis aucupium atque venatio. <a
  name="Sect_57"></a><a href="#Snot_57">57</a> Quid de pratorum viriditate
  aut arborum ordinibus aut vinearum olivetorumve specie plura dicam? Brevi
  praecidam. Agro bene culto nihil potest esse nec usu uberius nec specie
  ornatius, ad quem fruendum non modo non retardat, verum etiam invitat
  atque allectat senectus. Ubi enim potest illa aetas aut calescere vel
  apricatione melius vel igni, aut vicissim umbris aquisve refrigerari
  salubrius? <a name="Sect_58"></a><a href="#Snot_58">58</a> Sibi habeant
  igitur arma, sibi equos, sibi hastas, sibi clavam et pilam, sibi
  venationes atque cursus, nobis senibus ex lusionibus multis talos
  relinquant et tesseras; id ipsum ut lubebit, quoniam sine eis beata esse
  senectus potest.</p>

  <p>XVII. <a name="Sect_59"></a><a href="#Snot_59">59</a> Multas ad res
  perutiles Xenophontis libri sunt, quos legite quaeso studiose, ut
  facitis. Quam <!-- Page 25 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_25"></a>[pg 25]</span> copiose ab eo agri cultura laudatur in
  eo libro, qui est de tuenda re familiari, qui Oeconomicus inscribitur!
  Atque ut intellegatis nihil ei tam regale videri quam studium agri
  colendi, Socrates in eo libro loquitur cum Critobulo Cyrum minorem
  Persarum regem, praestantem ingenio atque imperi gloria, cum Lysander
  Lacedaemonius, vir summae virtutis, venisset ad eum Sardis eique dona a
  sociis attulisset, et ceteris in rebus communem erga Lysandrum atque
  humanum fuisse et ei quendam consaeptum agrum diligenter consitum
  ostendisse. Cum autem admiraretur Lysander et proceritates arborum et
  directos in quincuncem ordines et humum subactam atque puram et
  suavitatem odorum qui afflarentur ex floribus, tum eum dixisse mirari se
  non modo diligentiam sed etiam sollertiam eius a quo essent illa dimensa
  atque discripta; et Cyrum respondisse 'atqui ego ista sum omnia dimensus,
  mei sunt ordines, mea discriptio; multae etiam istarum arborum mea manu
  sunt satae.' Tum Lysandrum, intuentem purpuram eius et nitorem corporis
  ornatumque Persicum multo auro multisque gemmis, dixisse 'recte vero te,
  Cyre, beatum ferunt, quoniam virtuti tuae fortuna coniuncta est!' <a
  name="Sect_60"></a><a href="#Snot_60">60</a> Hac igitur fortuna frui
  licet senibus, nec aetas impedit quo minus et ceterarum rerum et in
  primis agri colendi studia teneamus usque ad ultimum tempus senectutis.
  M. quidem Valerium Corvinum accepimus ad centesimum annum perduxisse, cum
  esset acta iam aetate in agris eosque coleret, cuius inter primum et
  sextum consulatum sex et quadraginta anni interfuerunt. Ita quantum
  spatium aetatis maiores ad senectutis initium esse voluerunt, tantus illi
  cursus honorum fuit; atque huius extrema aetas hoc beatior quam media,
  quod auctoritatis <!-- Page 26 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_26"></a>[pg 26]</span> habebat plus, laboris minus; apex est
  autem senectutis auctoritas. <a name="Sect_61"></a><a
  href="#Snot_61">61</a> Quanta fuit in L. Caecilio Metello, quanta in A.
  Atilio Calatino! In quem illud elogium:</p>

  <div class="noflo">
    <div class="nofblk">
      <p><i>hunc unum plurimae consentiunt gentes</i></p>
      <p><i>populi primarium fuisse virum.</i></p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Notum est totum carmen incisum in sepulcro. Iure igitur gravis, cuius
  de laudibus omnium esset fama consentiens. Quem virum nuper P. Crassum,
  pontificem maximum, quem postea M. Lepidum eodem sacerdotio praeditum
  vidimus! Quid de Paulo aut Africano loquar, aut, ut iam ante, de Maximo?
  Quorum non in sententia solum, sed etiam in nutu residebat auctoritas.
  Habet senectus, honorata praesertim, tantam auctoritatem, ut ea pluris
  sit quam omnes adulescentiae voluptates.</p>

  <p>XVIII. <a name="Sect_62"></a><a href="#Snot_62">62</a> Sed in omni
  oratione mementote eam me senectutem laudare, quae fundamentis
  adulescentiae constituta sit. Ex quo efficitur id, quod ego magno quondam
  cum assensu omnium dixi, miseram esse senectutem quae se oratione
  defenderet. Non cani nec rugae repente auctoritatem arripere possunt, sed
  honeste acta superior aetas fructus capit auctoritatis extremos. <a
  name="Sect_63"></a><a href="#Snot_63">63</a> Haec enim ipsa sunt
  honorabilia, quae videntur levia atque communia, salutari appeti decedi
  assurgi deduci reduci consuli, quae et apud nos et in aliis civitatibus,
  ut quaeque optime morata est, ita diligentissime observantur. Lysandrum
  Lacedaemonium, cuius modo feci mentionem, dicere aiunt solitum
  Lacedaemonem esse honestissimum domicilium senectutis; nusquam enim
  tantum tribuitur aetati, nusquam est senectus honoratior. Quin etiam
  memoriae proditum est, cum Athenis ludis quidam in theatrum grandis natu
  venisset, magno <!-- Page 27 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_27"></a>[pg 27]</span> consessu locum nusquam ei datum a suis
  civibus, cum autem ad Lacedaemonios accessisset, qui, legati cum essent
  certo in loco considerant, consurrexisse omnes illi dicuntur et senem
  sessum recepisse; <a name="Sect_64"></a><a href="#Snot_64">64</a> quibus
  cum a cuncto consessu plausus esset multiplex datus, dixisse ex eis
  quendam Atheniensis scire quae recta essent, sed facere nolle. Multa in
  nostro collegio praeclara, sed hoc de quo agimus, in primis, quod, ut
  quisque aetate antecedit, ita sententiae principatum tenet, neque solum
  honore antecedentibus, sed eis etiam, qui cum imperio sunt, maiores natu
  augures anteponuntur. Quae sunt igitur voluptates corporis cum
  auctoritatis praemiis comparandae? Quibus qui splendide usi sunt, ei mihi
  videntur fabulam aetatis peregisse nec tamquam inexercitati histriones in
  extremo actu corruisse.</p>

  <p><a name="Sect_65"></a><a href="#Snot_65">65</a> At sunt morosi et
  anxii et iracundi et difficiles senes. Si quaerimus, etiam avari; sed
  haec morum vitia sunt, non senectutis. Ac morositas tamen et ea vitia,
  quae dixi, habent aliquid excusationis, non illius quidem iustae, sed
  quae probari posse videatur: contemni se putant, despici, illudi;
  praeterea in fragili corpore odiosa omnis offensio est; quae tamen omnia
  dulciora fiunt et moribus bonis et artibus, idque cum in vita tum in
  scaena intellegi potest ex eis fratribus qui in Adelphis sunt. Quanta in
  altero diritas, in altero comitas! Sic se res habet: ut enim non omne
  vinum, sic non omnis natura vetustate coacescit. Severitatem in senectute
  probo, sed eam, sicut alia, modicam; acerbitatem nullo modo; <a
  name="Sect_66"></a><a href="#Snot_66">66</a> avaritia vero senilis quid
  sibi velit, non intellego. Potest enim quicquam esse absurdius quam, quo
  viae minus restet, eo plus viatici quaerere?</p>

  <p>XIX. Quarta restat causa, quae maxime angere atque <!-- Page 28
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28"></a>[pg 28]</span> sollicitam
  habere nostram aetatem videtur, appropinquatio mortis, quae certe a
  senectute non potest esse longe. O miserum senem, qui mortem contemnendam
  esse in tam longa aetate non viderit! Quae aut plane neglegenda est, si
  omnino exstinguit animum, aut etiam optanda, si aliquo eum deducit ubi
  sit futurus aeternus. Atqui tertium certe nihil inveniri potest. <a
  name="Sect_67"></a><a href="#Snot_67">67</a> Quid igitur timeam, si aut
  non miser post mortem, aut beatus etiam futurus sum? Quamquam quis est
  tam stultus, quamvis sit adulescens, cui sit exploratum se ad vesperum
  esse victurum? Quin etiam aetas illa multo pluris quam nostra casus
  mortis habet: facilius in morbos incidunt adulescentes, gravius
  aegrotant, tristius curantur. Itaque pauci veniunt ad senectutem; quod ni
  ita accideret, melius et prudentius viveretur. Mens enim et ratio et
  consilium in senibus est, qui si nulli fuissent, nullae omnino civitates
  fuissent. Sed redeo ad mortem impendentem. Quod est istud crimen
  senectutis, cum id ei videatis cum adulescentia esse commune? <a
  name="Sect_68"></a><a href="#Snot_68">68</a> Sensi ego in optimo filio,
  tu in exspectatis ad amplissimam dignitatem fratribus, Scipio, mortem
  omni aetati esse communem. At sperat adulescens diu se victurum, quod
  sperare idem senex non potest. Insipienter sperat; quid enim stultius
  quam incerta pro certis habere, falsa pro veris? At senex ne quod speret
  quidem habet. At est eo meliore condicione quam adulescens, quoniam id
  quod ille sperat hic consecutus est: ille volt diu vivere, hic diu vixit.
  <a name="Sect_69"></a><a href="#Snot_69">69</a> Quamquam, o di boni, quid
  est in hominis natura diu? Da enim supremum tempus, exspectemus
  Tartessiorum regis aetatem: fuit enim, ut scriptum video, Arganthonius
  quidam Gadibus, qui octoginta regnaverat annos, centum viginti
  vixerat.</p>

<!-- Page 29 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29"></a>[pg 29]</span>

  <p>Sed mihi ne diuturnum quidem quicquam videtur, in quo est aliquid
  extremum; cum enim id advenit, tum illud quod praeteriit, effluxit;
  tantum remanet, quod virtute et recte factis consecutus sis. Horae quidem
  cedunt et dies et menses et anni, nec praeteritum tempus umquam
  revertitur nec quid sequatur sciri potest. Quod cuique temporis ad
  vivendum datur, eo debet esse contentus. <a name="Sect_70"></a><a
  href="#Snot_70">70</a> Neque enim histrioni, ut placeat, peragenda fabula
  est, modo in quocunque fuerit actu probetur; neque sapientibus usque ad
  'plaudite' veniendum est, breve enim tempus aetatis satis longum est ad
  bene honesteque vivendum; sin processerit longius, non magis dolendum
  est, quam agricolae dolent praeterita verni temporis suavitate aestatem
  autumnumque venisse. Ver enim tamquam adulescentia significat ostenditque
  fructus futuros; reliqua autem tempora demetendis fructibus et
  percipiendis accommodata sunt. <a name="Sect_71"></a><a
  href="#Snot_71">71</a> Fructus autem senectutis est, ut saepe dixi, ante
  partorum bonorum memoria et copia. Omnia autem, quae secundum naturam
  fiunt, sunt habenda in bonis; quid est autem tam secundum naturam quam
  senibus emori? Quod idem contingit adulescentibus adversante et
  repugnante natura. Itaque adulescentes mihi mori sic videntur, ut cum
  aquae multitudine flammae vis opprimitur, senes autem sic, ut cum sua
  sponte, nulla adhibita vi, consumptus ignis exstinguitur, et quasi poma
  ex arboribus, cruda si sunt, vix evelluntur, si matura et cocta,
  decidunt, sic vitam adulescentibus vis aufert, senibus maturitas; quae
  quidem mihi tam iucunda est, ut, quo propius ad mortem accedam, quasi
  terram videre videar aliquandoque in portum ex longa navigatione esse
  venturus.</p>

  <p>XX. <a name="Sect_72"></a><a href="#Snot_72">72</a> Senectutis autem
  nullus est certus terminus, <!-- Page 30 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_30"></a>[pg 30]</span> recteque in ea vivitur, quoad munus
  offici exsequi et tueri possit mortemque contemnere, ex quo fit ut
  animosior etiam senectus sit quam adulescentia et fortior. Hoc illud est,
  quod Pisistrato tyranno a Solone responsum est, cum illi quaerenti qua
  tandem re fretus sibi tam audaciter obsisteret respondisse dicitur
  'senectute.' Sed vivendi est finis optimus, cum integra mente certisque
  sensibus opus ipsa suum eadem quae coagmentavit natura dissolvit. Ut
  navem, ut aedificium idem destruit facillime qui construxit, sic hominem
  eadem optime quae conglutinavit natura dissolvit. Iam omnis conglutinatio
  recens aegre, inveterata facile divellitur. Ita fit ut illud breve vitae
  reliquum nec avide appetendum senibus nec sine causa deserendum sit;
  vetatque Pythagoras iniussu imperatoris, id est dei, de praesidio et
  statione vitae decedere. <a name="Sect_73"></a><a href="#Snot_73">73</a>
  Solonis quidem sapientis est elogium, quo se negat velle suam mortem
  dolore amicorum et lamentis vacare. Volt, credo, se esse carum suis. Sed
  haud scio an melius Ennius:</p>

  <div class="noflo">
    <div class="nofblk">
      <p><i>nemo me lacrumis decoret, neque funera fletu</i></p>
      <p><i>faxit</i></p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p><a name="Sect_74"></a><a href="#Snot_74">74</a> Non censet lugendam
  esse mortem, quam immortalitas consequatur. Iam sensus moriendi aliquis
  esse potest, isque ad exiguum tempus, praesertim seni: post mortem quidem
  sensus aut optandus aut nullus est. Sed hoc meditatum ab adulescentia
  debet esse, mortem ut neglegamus; sine qua meditatione tranquillo animo
  esse nemo potest. Moriendum enim certe est, et incertum an hoc ipso die.
  Mortem igitur omnibus horis impendentem timens qui poterit animo
  consistere? <a name="Sect_75"></a><a href="#Snot_75">75</a> De qua non
  ita longa disputatione opus esse videtur, cum recorder <!-- Page 31
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31"></a>[pg 31]</span> non L.
  Brutum, qui in liberanda patria est interfectus, non duos Decios, qui ad
  voluntariam mortem cursum equorum incitaverunt, non M. Atilium, qui ad
  supplicium est profectus ut fidem hosti datam conservaret non duos
  Scipiones, qui iter Poenis vel corporibus suis obstruere voluerunt, non
  avum tuum L. Paulum, qui morte luit collegae in Cannensi ignominia
  temeritatem, non M. Marcellum, cuius interitum ne crudelissimus quidem
  hostis honore sepulturae carere passus est, sed legiones nostras, quod
  scripsi in Originibus, in eum locum saepe profectas alacri animo et
  erecto, unde se redituras numquam arbitrarentur. Quod igitur
  adulescentes, et ei quidem non solum indocti sed etiam rustici
  contemnunt, id docti senes extimescent? <a name="Sect_76"></a><a
  href="#Snot_76">76</a> Omnino, ut mihi quidem videtur, rerum omnium
  satietas vitae facit satietatem. Sunt pueritiae studia certa: num igitur
  ea desiderant adulescentes? Sunt ineuntis adulescentiae: num ea constans
  iam requirit aetas, quae media dicitur? Sunt etiam eius aetatis: ne ea
  quidem quaeruntur in senectute. Sunt extrema quaedam studia senectutis:
  ergo, ut superiorum aetatum studia occidunt, sic occidunt etiam
  senectutis; quod cum evenit, satietas vitae tempus maturum mortis
  affert.</p>

  Pythagoriosque, incolas paene nostros, qui essent Italici philosophi
  quondam nominati numquam dubitasse quin ex universa mente divina
  delibatos animos haberemus. Demonstrabantur mihi praeterea quae Socrates
  supremo vitae die de immortalitate animorum disseruisset, is qui esset
  omnium sapientissimus oraculo Apollinis iudicatus. Quid multa? Sic mihi
  persuasi, sic sentio, cum tanta celeritas animorum sit, tanta memoria
  praeteritorum futurorumque prudentia, tot artes tantae scientiae, tot
  inventa, non posse eam naturam, quae res eas contineat, esse mortalem;
  cumque semper agitetur animus nec principium motus habeat, quia se ipse
  moveat, ne finem quidem habiturum esse motus, quia numquam se ipse sit
  relicturus; et cum simplex animi natura esset neque haberet in se
  quicquam admixtum dispar sui atque dissimile, non posse eum dividi, quod
  si non posset, non posse interire; magnoque esse argumento homines scire
  pleraque ante quam nati sint, quod iam pueri, cum artis difficilis
  discant, ita celeriter res innumerabilis arripiant, ut eas non tum primum

  nec vero tum animum esse insipientem cum ex insipienti corpore evasisset,
  sed cum omni admixtione corporis liberatus purus et integer esse

<h2>NOTES  TO  CATO  MAIOR.</h2>

<hr />

  <p>CATO MAIOR DE SENECTUTE (CATO THE ELDER ON OLD AGE). CATO MAIOR was
  probably intended by Cicero as the principal title. He twice gives the
  work this name, in Laelius 4 and Att. 14, 21, 1. In the former passage he
  adds the descriptive words, addressed to Atticus, <i>qui est scriptus ad
  te de senectute.</i> In a third notice, De Div. 2, 3, he gives the
  description without the title, <i>liber is quem ad nostrum Atticum de
  senectute misimus.</i> It is likely that Cicero intended the essay to be
  known as the CATO MAIOR DE SENECTUTE, the full title corresponding with
  LAELIUS DE AMICITIA. The word <i>maior</i> was necessary to distinguish
  the book from Cicero's eulogy of the younger Cato (Uticensis), which
  seems to have gone by the name of CATO simply.</p>

  <p><b>P. <a href="#Page_1">1</a> &mdash; <a name="Snot_1"></a><a
  href="#Sect_1">1.</a> O Tite</b> etc.: the lines are a quotation from the
  <i>Annales</i> of Q. Ennius (born at Rudiae in Calabria 239 B.C., died
  169), an epic poem in hexameter verse, the first great Latin poem in that
  metre, celebrating the achievements of the Roman nation from the time of
  Aeneas to the poet's own days. The incident alluded to in Ennius' verses
  is evidently the same as that narrated by Livy 32, cc. 9, 10. Titus
  Quinctius Flamininus, who commanded in 198 B.C. the Roman army opposed to
  Philip of Macedon, found the king strongly posted on the mountains
  between Epirus and Thessaly. For forty days Flamininus lingered, hoping
  to find some path which would give him access to the enemy's quarters. A
  shepherd who knew every nook of the mountains came before the general,
  and promised to lead the Roman soldiers to the ground above Philip's
  camp. This was done, and Flamininus drove the Macedonians into
  Thessaly. It is the shepherd who in the first line addresses Flamininus
  by his first name Titus. Cicero here cleverly applies the lines to his
  life-long friend Titus Pomponius Atticus. He several times takes the two
  words <i>'O Tite'</i> to designate the whole treatise; cf. Att. 16, 11, 3
  <i>'O Tite' tibi prodesse laetor</i>. &mdash; <b>quid</b>: accusative of
  respect or extent; so <i>nihil</i> in <a href="#Sect_30">30</a>,
  <i>aliquid</i> in <a href="#Sect_82">82</a>. A.<a name="NtA_56"></a><a
  href="#Nt_56"><sup>[56]</sup></a> 240, <i>a</i>; G. 331, 3; H. 378, 2.
  &mdash; <b>adi&#365;ero</b>: for <i>adi&#363;vero,</i> the long vowel
  having become short after the falling out of the <i>v</i> between the two
  vowels. Catullus 66, 18 has <i>i&#365;erint</i> at the end of a
  pentameter verse, and the same scanning is found in Plautus and Terence.
  A. 128, <i>a</i>; G. 151, 1; H. 235. &mdash; <b>levasso</b>: a form of
  <i>levavero,</i> which was originally <i>levaveso</i>. For the formation
  of this class of future-perfects see Peile, <i>Introduction to Greek and
  Latin Etymology,</i> p. 295, ed. 3; also Roby, <i>Gram.</i> 1, p. 199,
  who has a list of examples; he supports a different view from that given
  above; cf. A. 128, <i>e</i>, 3; G. 191, 5; H. 240, 4. &mdash;
  <b>coquit</b>: 'vexes.' This metaphorical use of <i>coquere</i> occurs in
  poetry and late prose; cf. Plaut. Trin. 225 <i>egomet me coquo et macero
  et defetigo</i>; Verg. Aen. 7, 345 <i>quam ... femineae ardentem curaeque
  iraeque coquebant</i>; Quint. 12, 10, 77 <i>sollititudo oratorem macerat
  et coquit</i>. &mdash; <b>vers&#257;t</b>: we have here the original
  quantity of the vowel preserved, as in <i>poneb&#257;t</i> below, <a
  href="#Sect_10">10</a>; the <i>a</i> in <i>versat</i> was originally as
  long as the <i>a</i> in <i>vers&#257;s</i>. Plautus has some parallels to
  this scanning (see Corssen, Aussprache 11², 488), but it is rarely
  imitated by poets of the best period. Horace, however, has
  <i>ar&#257;t</i>, Odes 3, 16, 26. A. 375, <i>g</i>, 5; H. 580, III n. 2.
  &mdash; <b>praemi</b>: the genitive in <i>&#301;-&#299;</i> from nouns in
  <i>ium</i> only began to come into use at the end of the Republic. A. 40,
  <i>b</i>; G. 29, Rem. 1; H. 51, 5. &mdash; <b>isdem</b>: Cicero may have
  written <i>isdem</i> or <i>eisdem</i> (two syllables), but he probably
  did not write the form most commonly found in our texts, <i>iisdem.</i>
  H. p. 74, foot-note 2. &mdash; <b>Flamininum</b>: T. Quinctius
  Flamin&#299;nus first served against Hannibal during the Second Punic
  War. He was present at the capture of Tarentum in 209 B. c., and in 208
  was military tribune under Marcellus. After being employed on minor
  business of state, he became quaestor in 199, and, immediately after his
  year of office, consul, passing over the aedileship and praetorship, and
  attaining the consulship at the extraordinarily early age of 30. In 197
  he won the victory of Cynoscephalae over the
  Macedonians, which ended the war. At the Isthmian games in the spring of
  196 Flamininus made his famous proclamation of freedom to all the Greeks.
  He returned to Rome in 194 to enjoy a splendid triumph. For the rest of
  his life was employed chiefly on diplomatic business concerning Greece
  and the East. One of his embassies was to Prusias, king of Bithynia, call
  on him to surrender Hannibal, who was living at his court in advanced old
  age; this led to Hannibal's suicide. Flamininus was censor in 189 (see
  below, 42), and lived on till some time after 167, in which year he
  became augur; but the date of his death is unknown. He was a man of
  brilliant ability both as general and as diplomat, and also possessed
  much culture and was a great admirer of Greek literature. &mdash; <b>ille
  vir</b> etc.: <i>i.e.</i> the shepherd mentioned in n. on line 1. Livy
  32, II, 4 says that Flamininus sent to the master of the shepherd,
  Charopus, an Epirote prince, to ask how far he might be trusted. Charopus
  replied that Flamininus might trust him, but had better keep a close
  watch on the operations himself. &mdash; <b>haud magna cum re</b>: 'of no
  great property'; <i>re</i> = <i>re familiari</i>, as is often the case
  elsewhere in both verse and prose. Cf. pro Caelio 78 <i>hominem sine re.
  Cum</i> is literally 'attended by'; it is almost superfluous here, since
  <i>vir haud magna re</i> would have had just the same meaning. Madvig,
  Gram. § 258 has similar examples. &mdash; <b>plenus</b>: final <i>s</i>
  was so lightly pronounced that the older poets felt justified in
  neglecting it in their scanning. It was probably scarcely pronounced at
  all by the less educated Romans, since it is often wholly omitted in
  inscriptions, and has been lost in modern Italian. Cicero, Orator 161,
  says that the neglect to pronounce final <i>s</i> is 'somewhat boorish'
  (<i>subrusticum</i>), though formerly thought 'very refined'
  (<i>politius</i>). Even Lucretius sometimes disregards it in his
  scanning. In the ordinary literary Latin a large number of words has lost
  an original <i>s</i>; <i>e.g.</i> all the nouns of the <i>-a</i>
  declension. A. 375, <i>a</i>; G. 722; H. 608, 1, n. 3. &mdash;
  <b>fid&#275;i</b>: this form of the genitive of <i>fides</i> is found
  also in Plautus, Aulularia 575, and Lucretius 5, 102. <i>Fid&#277;i</i>
  as genitive seems only to occur in late poets, but as dative it is found
  in a fragment of Ennius. <i>Fid&#275;</i> as genitive occurs in Horace
  and Ovid. H. 585, III. 1; Roby, 357, (c). &mdash; <b>quamquam</b>: see <a
  href="#Snot_2">n. on 2</a> <i>etsi</i>. &mdash; <b>sollicitari</b> etc.:
  Cicero probably has not quoted the line as Ennius wrote it. The word
  <i>sic</i>, at least, is evidently inserted on purpose to correspond with
  <i>ut</i> before <i>Flamininum</i>. &mdash; <b>noctesque diesque</b>: the
  use of <i>que ... que</i> for <i>et ... et</i> is almost entirely
  poetical, Sallust being the only prose writer of the best period in whose
  works the usage is beyond doubt. <i>Noctes</i> is put before <i>dies</i>
  here, as in <i>noctes diesque</i> (Verr. 5, 112), <i>noctes et dies</i>
  (Brut. 308 <i>etc.</i>), <i>nodes ac dies</i> (Arch. 29); cf. also Verg.
  Aen. 6, 127; and <span lang="el" title="nuktas te kai êmar">&#x3BD;&#x3C5;&#x3BA;&#x3C4;&#x3B1;&#x3C2; &#x3C4;&#x3B5;
  &#x3BA;&#x3B1;&#x3B9; &#x3B7;&#x3BC;&#x3B1;&#x3C1;</span> in Iliad 5,
  490; but the collocations <i>dies noctesque</i>, <i>dies et noctes</i>
  are far commoner in Cicero. Madvig (Emend. Liv. p. 487 n., ed 2) says that
  in writers of Livy's time and earlier, when an action is mentioned which
  continues throughout a number of days and nights, either <i>dies et
  noctes</i> and the like phrases are used, or <i>die et nocte</i> and the
  like, but not <i>diem noctemque</i> or <i>diem et noctem,</i> which
  expression, he says, would imply that the action continued only
  throughout <i>one</i> day and <i>one</i> night. But Madvig has overlooked
  De Or. 2, 162 <i>eandem incu dem diem noctemque tundentibus;</i> also
  three passages of Caesar: viz. Bell. Gall. 7, 42, 6 and 7, 77, 11; Bell.
  Civ. 1, 62, 1; to which add a passage in the Bell. Hisp. 38. Though
  <i>diem noctemque</i> does often mean 'throughout <i>one</i> day and
  <i>one</i> night' (as <i>e.g.</i> in Nep. Them. 8, 7), yet it would seem
  that the other sense cannot be excluded. &mdash; <b>moderationem ...
  aequitatem</b>: 'the self-control and even balance of your mind'.
  <i>Moderatio</i> is in Cic. a common translation of
  <span lang="el"
  title="sôphrosynê">&#x3C3;&#x3C9;&#x3C6;&#x3C1;&#x3BF;&#x3C3;&#x3C5;&#x3BD;&#x3B7;</span>.
  <i>Aequitas</i> is not used here in its commonest sense of
  'reasonableness' or 'equity', but as the noun corresponding to
  <i>aequus</i> in the ordinary phrase <i>aequus animus</i> (Horace,
  '<i>aequam memento rebus in arduis servare mentem</i>'), cf. Tusc. 1, 97
  <i>hanc maximi animi aequitatem in ipsa morte.</i> said of Theramenes'
  undisturbed composure before his execution. &mdash; <b>animi tui</b>: for
  the position of these words between <i>moderationem</i> and
  <i>aequitatem</i>, to both of which nouns they refer (a form of speech
  called by the Latin grammarians <i>coniunctio</i>), see note on Laelius 8
  <i>cum summi viri tum amicissimi</i>. &mdash; <b>cognomen</b>:
  <i>i.e.</i> the name <i>Atticus</i>, which Cicero's friend did not
  inherit, but adopted. For the word <i>cognomen</i> cf. <a
  href="#Snot_5">n. on 5</a>. &mdash; <b>deportasse</b>: it should be noted
  that the verb <i>deportare</i> is nearly always in the best writers used
  of bringing things from the provinces to Italy or Rome, and not <i>vice
  versa</i>, the Romans using 'down' (<i>de</i>) of motion towards the
  capital. <i>Italia deportare</i> occurs in Tacitus and late writers, but
  only in the sense of banishing a person (cf. Ann 14, 45). So <i>decedere
  de provincia</i> is common, but not <i>Roma decedere</i>. As to the form
  <i>deportasse</i>, it may be remarked that Cic. in the vast majority of
  instances uses the contracted and not the full forms of the infinitives
  corresponding to perfects in -<i>avi</i>. So <i>putassent</i> in 4. An
  extensive collection of examples of this and similar contractions may be
  found in Frohwein, Die Perfectbildungen auf -vi bei Cicero; Gera, 1874.
  &mdash; <b>humanitatem</b>: 'culture', <i>i.e.</i> learning  resulting
  in gentleness  and  refinement of character. &mdash; <b>prudentiam</b>:
  <span
  lang="el"
  title="phronêsin">&#x3C6;&#x3C1;&#x3BF;&#x3BD;&#x3B7;&#x3C3;&#x3B9;&#x3BD;</span> or practical wisdom.
  Corn. Nepos (or his imitator) in his life of Atticus 17, 3 says of him
  <i>principum philosophorum ita percepta habuit praecepta ut his ad vitam
  agendam non ad ostentationem uteretur</i>. &mdash; <b>isdem rebus</b>:
  <i>i.e.</i> the state of public affairs at the time, see <a href="#Page_vi">Introd</a>. &mdash;
  <b>quibus me ipsum</b>: strictly speaking the construction is inaccurate,
  since <i>suspicor commoveri</i> must be supplied, and Cicero does not
  really mean to say that he merely <i>conjectures</i> himself to be
  seriously affected by the state of public affairs; <i>ego ipse
  commoveor</i> would have accurately expressed his meaning. The accusative
  is due to the attraction of <i>te</i> above. &mdash; <b>maior</b>: =
  <i>difficilior</i> as often; <i>e.g.</i> Lael. 29 <i>quod maius est</i>.
  &mdash; <b>visum est mihi conscribere</b>: = <i>placuit mihi</i>, 'I have
  determined to write'. The best writers rarely use the impersonal
  <i>videtur etc.</i> followed by an infinitive. When the usage occurs
  <i>videtur mihi etc.</i> generally have the meaning (as here) of
  <span lang="el" title="dokei moi k.t.l.">&#x3B4;&#x3BF;&#x3BA;&#x3B5;&#x3B9; &#x3BC;&#x3BF;&#x3B9; &#x3BA;
  &#x3C4; &#x3BB;</span> = 'I have made up my mind'. Cf. Tusc. 5, 12 <i>Non
  mihi videtur ad beate vivendum satis posse virtutem</i>; ib. 5, 22 (a
  curious passage) <i>mihi enim non videbatur quisquam esse beatus posse
  cum esset in malis; in malis autem sapientem esse posse</i>; Off 3, 71
  <i>malitia quae volt illa quidem videri se esse prudentiam</i> ('craft
  which desires that people should believe it to be wisdom'); Liv. 1, 10, 7
  <i>dis visum nec irritam conditoris templi vocem esse</i> ... ('the gods
  decided that the word of the founder of the shrine should not remain of
  no effect'). It would be difficult, if not impossible, to find a passage
  in a writer before silver Latin times where the best texts still exhibit
  anything like <i>videtur eum facere</i> for <i>is videtur facere</i>. H
  534, 1, n. 1; Roby, 1353. &mdash; <b>aliquid ad te</b>: 'some work
  dedicated to you'; so below, <a href="#Sect_3">3</a>; cf. also Lael. 4
  <i>ut de amicitia scriberem aliquid</i>; ib. <i>Catone maiore qui est
  scriptus ad te de senectute</i>; Div. 2, 3 <i>liber is quem ad nostrum
  Atticum de senectute misimus.</i></p>

  <p><b><a name="Snot_2"></a><a href="#Sect_2">2.</a> aut ... aut
  certe</b>: so often in Cic.; <i>certe</i>, 'at any rate'. &mdash;
  <b>senectutis</b>: at the time the words were written Cic. was 62 years
  old, Atticus three years older. For the meaning of <i>senectus</i> see <a
  href="#Snot_4">n. on 4</a>. &mdash; <b>levari volo</b>: the best Latin
  writers frequently use the passive infinitive after verbs expressing
  desire, where moderns would incline to the active; here Cic. instead of
  saying 'I wish to relieve yourself and me of the
  burden' says 'I wish yourself and me to be relieved'. &mdash;
  <b>etsi</b>: = <span lang="el"
  title="kaitoi">&#x3BA;&#x3B1;&#x3B9;&#x3C4;&#x3BF;&#x3B9;</span> 'and yet'.
  This use of <i>etsi</i> to introduce a clause correcting the preceding
  clause, though not uncommon (<i>e.g.</i> below <a href="#Sect_29">29</a>;
  Tusc. 1, 99; 3, 17; 4, 63; 5, 55), is far less common than that of
  <i>quamquam</i>, which we have in <a href="#Sect_1">1</a>, <a
  href="#Sect_9">9</a>, <a href="#Sect_10">10</a>, <a
  href="#Sect_24">24</a>, <a href="#Sect_47">47</a>, <a
  href="#Sect_67">67</a>, <a href="#Sect_69">69</a>. &mdash; <b>te
  quidem</b>: 'you at all events', 'you for one'. &mdash; <b>modice ac
  sapienter</b>: <i>modice</i> recalls <i>moderationem</i> above
  (<i>modice</i> and <i>moderate</i> are used with exactly the same sense
  by Cic.), while <i>sapienter</i> recalls <i>aequitatem</i>, since
  <i>sapientia</i> produces stability and an even balance of the mind. In
  De Or. 1, 132 we have <i>modice et scienter</i>. &mdash; <b>sicut
  omnia</b>: cf. Fin. 1, 7 <i>facete is quidem sicut alia</i>; also below,
  65 <i>sicut alia</i>. &mdash; <b>et ferre et laturum esse</b>: Tischer
  rightly remarks that when a verb is repeated thus with a variation of
  tense Cic. very nearly always uses <i>et ... et</i>, and not a single
  <i>et</i> merely. The contrast between the two tenses is thus made more
  pointed. Cf. 3 <i>et diximus et dicemus</i>. &mdash; <b>certo scio</b>:
  one of the best MSS., followed by some editors, has here <i>certe
  scio</i>. The latter phrase would mean 'I am sure that I know'(a sense
  which seems out of place here); the former 'I have certain or sure
  knowledge'. Observe that <i>certe</i> may be used with all verbs, while
  <i>certo</i> is only used with <i>scire</i>. A. 151, <i>c</i>. &mdash;
  <b>sed</b>: the idea implied is, 'but though I well know you do not need
  such consolation, I have yet resolved to address my book to you'. &mdash;
  <b>occurrebas dignus</b>: a condensed construction for <i>occurrebat te
  digmim esse</i>.</p>

  <p><b>P. <a href="#Page_2">2</a> &mdash; munere ... uteretur</b>: 'a gift
  such as we both might make use of in company'. &mdash; <b>mihi
  quidem</b>: this forms a correction upon <i>uterque nostrum</i> above:
  'whatever you may think of the work, <i>I at least</i> have found the
  writing of it pleasant'. &mdash; <b>confectio</b>: 'composition';
  'completion'; a word scarcely found in the classical Latin except in
  Cicero's writings. Cf. De Or. 2, 52 <i>annalium confectio;</i> pro. Font.
  3 <i>confectio tabularum</i> ('account-books'). &mdash; <b>fuit ut
  absterserit</b>: the sequence of tenses <i>fuit ut abstergeret</i> would
  have been equally admissible, but the meaning would have been slightly
  different. With the perfect the sense is 'was so pleasant that it
  <i>has</i> wiped away'; with the imperfect 'was so pleasant that it
  <i>did</i> (while I was writing) wipe away'. The metaphor in
  <i>absterserit</i> is common: <i>e.g.</i> Tusc. 3, 43 <i>luctum omnem
  absterseris</i>. With this statement of Cicero's concerning the effect
  the work had on himself contrast Att. 14, 21, 3 <i>legendus mihi saepius
  est Cato maior ad te missus. Amariorem enim me senectus facit. Stomachor
  omnia</i>. &mdash; <b>omnis</b>: acc. pl. A. 55, <i>c</i>;
  G. 60, 1; H. 67. &mdash; <b>effecerit mollem</b>: so 56 <i>poteratne
  tantus animus efficere non iucundam senectutem</i>; but 56 <i>conditiora
  facit haec aucupium<i>. </i>Efficio</i> gives more emphatically than
  <i>facio</i> the idea of the completion of the action. Cf. Lael. 73
  <i>efficere aliquem consulem</i>, 'to carry through a man's election as
  consul'; <i>facere aliquem consulem</i> being merely 'to vote for a man's
  election to the consulship'. &mdash; <b>satis digne</b>: 'as she
  deserves', lit. 'in a sufficiently worthy manner.' Some editors have
  thought <i>digne</i> superfluous and wished to cast it out but we have
  <i>satis digne</i> elsewhere, as in Verr. Act. II. 1, 82; cf. also Sex.
  Rosc. 33 <i>pro dignitate laudare satis commode</i>. &mdash; <b>qui
  pareat ... degere</b>: a conditional sentence of irregular form
  (<i>qui</i> = <i>siquis</i>; <i>cui</i> simply connective, = <i>et
  ei</i>). Cf. Div. 1, 127 <i>qui enim teneat causas rerum futurarum, idem
  necesse est omnia teneat quae futura sint</i>; also the examples in
  Roby's Grammar, 1558. A. 310, <i>a</i>, 307, <i>b</i>; G. 594, 1, 598; H.
  507, II. and III. 2. Some, however, make <i>possit</i> a subjunctive of
  characteristic or of cause with <i>cui</i>, and <i>pareat</i> a
  subjunctive by attraction. &mdash; <b>omne tempus aetatis</b>: 'every
  season of life'; so in <a href="#Sect_55">55</a> <i>extremum tempus
  aetatis</i>; <a href="#Sect_70">70</a> <i>breve tempus aetatis.</i> The
  opposite phrase <i>aetas temporis</i> is very rare; it occurs in
  Propertius 1, 4, 7.</p>

  <p><b><a name="Snot_3"></a><a href="#Sect_3">3.</a> ceteris</b>: neuter
  adjective used as a noun, equivalent to <i>ceteris rebus</i> 'the other
  matters'; <i>i.e.</i> the political troubles hinted at above. The best
  writers do not often use the neuter adjective as noun in the
  <i>oblique</i> cases unless there is something in the context to show the
  gender clearly, as in <a href="#Sect_24">24</a> <i>aliis ... eis
  quae</i>; we have, however, below in <a href="#Sect_8">8</a>, <i>isto</i>
  = <i>ista re</i>; <a href="#Sect_72">72</a>, <i>reliquum</i>; <a
  href="#Sect_77">77</a>, <i>caelestium</i> = <i>rerum caelestium</i>; and
  in <a href="#Sect_78">78</a>, <i>praeteritorum futurorumque</i>; see
  other instances in n. on Lael. 50 <i>similium</i>. The proleptic or
  anticipatory use of <i>ceteris</i> should also be noticed; its sense is
  not fully seen till we come to <i>hunc librum</i>; the same use occurs
  below in <a href="#Sect_4">4</a>, <a href="#Sect_5">5</a>, <a
  href="#Sect_59">59</a>, <a href="#Sect_60">60</a>; so <i>aliis</i> in <a
  href="#Sect_24">24</a>; cf. also n. on Lael. 7 <i>reliqua</i>. &mdash;
  <b>diximus ... dicemus</b>: when a clause or phrase consists of four
  parts, which go in pairs (as here <i>diximus</i>, <i>dicemus</i> on one
  side, and <i>multa</i>, <i>saepe</i> on the other), the Latins frequently
  arrange the words so as to put one pair between the two members of the
  other pair, as here. This usage is called by grammarians <i>chiasmus</i>.
  Thus if we denote the four parts by <i>AA' BB', chiasmus</i> requires the
  order <i>ABB'A'</i> or <i>BAA'B'</i>. See examples in <a
  href="#Sect_8">8</a>, <a href="#Sect_20">20</a>, <a
  href="#Sect_22">22</a>, <a href="#Sect_38">38</a>, <a

  complicated forms of chiasmus consult Nägelsbach, Stil. §§ 167, 169. A.
  344, <i>f</i>; G. 684; H. 562. &mdash; <b>librum ... misimus</b>: observe
  the omission of a particle at the beginning of the clause; the
  contrast between <i>ceteris</i> and <i>hunc librum</i> is made stronger
  by the omission. For this <i>asyndeton adversativum</i> see n. on Lael. 5
  <i>Laelium ... putes</i>. For tense of <i>misimus</i>, 'I send' see A.
  282; G. 244, H. 472, 1. &mdash; <b>omnem</b>: see <a href="#Snot_62">n.
  on 62</a>. &mdash; <b>tribuimus</b>: perfect tense like <i>misimus</i>.
  &mdash; <b>Tithono ... Aristo</b>: see <a href="#Page_viii">Introd</a>. &mdash; <b>Cius</b>: Greek
  <span
  lang="el" title="Keios">&#x39A;&#x3B5;&#x3B9;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span> (a native of Ceos), not to
  be confused with <span lang="el"

  or <span lang="el" title="Kôos">&#x39A;&#x3C9;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span> (a native of Cos). Cicero
  generally denotes the Greek diphthong <span
  lang="el" title="ei">&#x3B5;&#x3B9;</span> by <i>i</i>
  not <i>e</i>. This Aristo was a Peripatetic. &mdash; <b>parum ...
  auctoritatis</b>: observe how often Cicero takes trouble to separate
  words which are, grammatically, closely connected. So above, <i>omnis ...
  molestias</i>; <a href="#Sect_7">7</a> <i>multorum ... senectutem</i>; <a
  href="#Sect_9">9</a> <i>mirificos ... fructus</i>; <a

  510. &mdash; <b>maiorem auctoritatem</b>: cf. Lael. 4. &mdash; <b>apud
  quem</b>: 'at whose house'; so <a href="#Sect_55">55</a> <i>a me</i>,
  'from my house'. A. 153; G. 417; H. 446, n. 4. &mdash; <b>Laelium ...
  Scipionem</b>: see <a href="#Page_xi">Introd</a>. &mdash; <b>facimus admirantis</b>: 'we
  represent as expressing astonishment'. For <i>facere</i>, in this sense,
  Cic. more often uses <i>inducere</i> 'to bring on the stage', as in Lael.
  4 <i>Catonem induxi senem disputantem</i>. Cf. however <a
  href="#Sect_54">54</a> <i>Homerus Laerten colentem agrum facit</i>; also
  Brut. 218; Orat 85. Instead of <i>facimus</i> we might have expected
  either <i>fecimus</i> to correspond with <i>misimus</i> and
  <i>tribuimus</i> above, or <i>faciemus</i> to correspond with
  <i>videbitur</i> below. On the use of the participle see A. 292,
  <i>q</i>; G. 536; H 535, I. 4. &mdash; <b>eruditius disputare</b>: Cic.
  not infrequently in his dialogues makes people talk with more learning
  than they really possessed. He several times confesses this as regards
  Lucullus and Catulus in the Academica, and as regards Antonius in the De
  Oratore. &mdash; <b>ferat</b>: subjunctive because embodying the
  sentiment of Laelius and Scipio. Roby, 1744; Madvig, 357; H. 516, 11.
  &mdash; <b>suis libris</b> etc.: for the allusions here to Cato's life,
  works, and opinions see <a href="#Page_iv">Introd</a>. &mdash; <b>quid opus est plura?</b>
  <i>sc. dicere</i>. cf. the elliptic phrases <i>quid multa? sc. dicam</i>
  in <a href="#Sect_78">78</a>; also below, <a href="#Sect_10">10</a>
  <i>praeclare</i>. A 206, <i>c</i>; H. 368, 3, n. 2.</p>

  <p><b><a name="Snot_4"></a><a href="#Sect_4">4.</a> saepe numero
  soleo</b>: 'it is my frequent custom'. <i>Numero</i> is literally 'by the
  count or reckoning', and in <i>saepe numero</i> had originally the same
  force as in <i>quadraginta numero</i> and the like; but the phrase came
  to be used merely as a slight strengthening of <i>saepe</i>. &mdash;
  <b>cum hoc ... cum ceterarum</b>: the use of <i>cum</i> in different
  senses in the same clause, which seems awkward, is not uncommon; cf.
  below, <a href="#Sect_67">67</a>. The spelling
  <i>quum</i> was certainly not used by Cicero, and probably by no other
  Latin writer of the best period. H. 311, foot-note 4. It is worth
  remarking that <i>cum</i> the conjunction and <i>cum</i> the preposition,
  though spelt alike, are by origin quite distinct. The former is derived
  from the pronominal stem <i>ka</i> or <i>kva</i>, and is cognate with
  <i>qui</i>; the latter comes from the root <i>sak</i> 'to follow', and is
  cognate with Gk. <span lang="el"
  title="syn">&#x3C3;&#x3C5;&#x3BD;</span>, Lat <i>sequor</i>, etc. See
  Vanicek, Etymologisches Worterbuch, pp. 96, 984. &mdash; <b>rerum ...
  sapientiam</b>: 'wisdom <i>in</i> affairs'; the objective genitive.
  &mdash; <b>excellentem</b>: in sense much stronger than our 'excellent';
  <i>excellentem perfectamque</i> 'pre-eminent and indeed faultless'.
  &mdash; <b>quod ... senserim</b>: this clause takes the place of an
  object to <i>admirari</i>. The subjunctive is used because the speaker
  reports his own reason for the wonder, formerly felt, as if according to
  the views of another person, and without affirming his holding the same
  view at the time of speaking. Madvig, 357, <i>a</i>, Obs. 1. A 341,
  <i>d</i>, Rem. &mdash; <b>odiosa</b>: this word is not so strong as our
  'hateful', but rather means 'wearisome', 'annoying'. In Plautus the
  frequent expression <i>odiosus es</i> means, in colloquial English, 'you
  bore me'. Cf. <a href="#Sect_47">47</a> <i>odiosum et molestum</i>; <a
  href="#Sect_65">65</a> <i>odiosa offensio</i>. &mdash; <b>onus Aetna
  gravius</b>: a proverbial expression with an allusion to Enceladus, who,
  after the defeat of the Giants by Juppiter, was said to have been
  imprisoned under Mt. Aetna. Cf. Eurip. Hercules Furens, 637; also
  Longfellow's poem, Enceladus. &mdash; <b>haud sane difficilem</b>:
  'surely far from difficult'; cf. <a href="#Sect_83">83</a> <i>haud sane
  facile</i>. &mdash; <b>quibus</b>: a <i>dativus commodi</i>, 'those for
  whom there is no aid in themselves'. Cf. Lael. 79 <i>quibus in ipsis</i>.
  &mdash; <b>bene beateque vivendum</b>: 'a virtuous and happy life';
  'virtue and happiness'; so <i>bene honesteque</i> below, <a
  href="#Sect_70">70</a>. &mdash; <b>qui ... petunt</b>: these are the
  <span
  lang="el"
  title="autarkeis">&#x3B1;&#x3C5;&#x3C4;&#x3B1;&#x3C1;&#x3BA;&#x3B5;&#x3B9;&#x3C2;</span>,
  men sufficient for themselves, '<i>in se toti teretes atque rotundi</i>'.
  We have here a reminiscence of the Stoic doctrine about the wise man,
  whose happiness is quite independent of everything outside himself, and
  is caused solely by his own virtue. Cicero represents the same Stoic
  theory in Lael. 7. Cf. Juv. Sat. 10, 357-362; also Seneca, De Cons. Sap.
  VIII, De Prov. I. 5. &mdash; <b>a se ipsi</b>: 'themselves from
  themselves,' so in <a href="#Sect_78">78</a> <i>se ipse moveat ... se
  ipse relucturus sit</i>; <a href="#Sect_84">84</a> <i>me ipse
  consolabar</i>. Expressions like <i>a se ipsis</i> are quite uncommon in
  Cicero. Cf. n. on Lael. 5 <i>te ipse cognosces</i>; also see below, <a
  href="#Sect_38">38</a> <i>se ipsa</i> <a href="#Sect_78">78</a> <i>se
  ipse</i>. &mdash; <b>naturae necessitas</b>: 'the inevitable conditions
  of nature.' Cf. <a href="#Sect_71">71</a> <i>quid est tam secundum naturam
  quam senibus emori?</i> &mdash; <b>afferat</b>: subjunctive because
  <i>nihil quod</i> = <i>nihil tale ut</i>. A 320, <i>a</i>; G. 633,
  634; H. 503, I. &mdash; <b>quo in genere</b>: <i>sc. rerum</i>; with this
  phrase the defining genitive is commonly omitted by Cicero. So below, <a
  href="#Sect_45">45</a> <i>in eo genere</i>. &mdash; <b>ut ...
  adeptam</b>: notice the chiasmus. &mdash; <b>eandem</b>: <i>idem</i> is
  used in the same way, to mark an emphatic contrast in <a
  href="#Sect_24">24</a>, <a href="#Sect_52">52</a>, <a
  href="#Sect_68">68</a>, <a href="#Sect_71">71</a>. &mdash;
  <b>adeptam</b>: this is probably the only example in Cicero of the
  passive use of <i>adeptus</i>, which occurs in Sallust, Ovid, Tacitus,
  etc.; and in this passage the use cannot be looked on as certain, since
  one of the very best and several of the inferior MSS. read <i>adepti</i>.
  Cicero, however, uses a good many deponent participles in a passive sense
  (cf. below, <a href="#Sect_59">59</a> <i>dimensa</i>; <a
  href="#Sect_74">74</a> <i>meditatum</i>; see also a list, Roby, 734), and
  some of them occur very rarely. Thus <i>periclitatus, arbitratus,
  depastus</i> as passives are found each in only one passage. &mdash;
  <b>inconstantia</b>: 'instability', 'inconsistency'. <i>Constantia</i>,
  unwavering firmness and consistency, is the characteristic of the wise
  man; cf. Acad. 2, 23 <i>sapientia ... quae ex sese habeat
  constantiam</i>; also Lael. 8 and 64.</p>

  <p><b>P. <a href="#Page_3">3</a> &mdash; aiunt</b>: <i>sc. stulti</i>.
  &mdash; <b>putassent</b>: the subjunctive is due to the indirect
  discourse. Where we say 'I should not have thought,' the Latins say, in
  direct narration, '<i>non putaram</i>,' <i>i.e.</i> 'I never had thought'
  (so Off. 1, 81 and often in Cicero's letters). Translate, 'more quickly
  than they had ever expected'. Cf. Att. 6, 1, 6 <i>accipiam equidem
  dolorem mihi ilium irasci sed multo maiorem non esse eum talem qualem
  putassem</i>. See Zumpt, Gram., 518. &mdash; <b>falsum putare</b>: 'to
  form a mistaken judgment'. For <i>falsum</i> as noun equivalent to
  <span
  lang="el"
  title="pseudos">&#x3C8;&#x3B5;&#x3C5;&#x3B4;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span>, cf. 6
  <i>gratissimum</i>; also <a href="#Snot_3">n. on 3</a> <i>ceteris</i>.
  &mdash; <b>qui citius</b>: lit. 'in what way quicker'; cf. Tusc. 5, 89
  <i>qui melius</i>. H. 188, II. 2. &mdash; <b>adulescentia ... senectus
  ... pueritia</b>: babyhood was generally at Rome supposed to last till
  the 17th year (the time for assuming the <i>toga virilis</i> and for
  beginning military service). <i>Iuventus</i> is usually the age from 17
  to 45, during which men were liable to be called on for active service.
  Ordinarily, in colloquial language, <i>adulescentia</i> is the earlier
  portion of <i>iuventus</i>, say the years from 17 to 30 (cf. 33), but
  Cicero seems here to make <i>adulescentia</i> co-extensive with
  <i>iuventus</i>. From 45 to 60 is the <i>aetas seniorum</i>, the period
  during which citizens in early Rome might be called out for the defence
  of the city, but not for active service. <i>Senectus</i> was commonly
  reckoned as beginning at 60; but in § <a href="#Sect_60">60</a> Cicero
  includes in <i>senectus</i> the <i>aetas seniorum</i>, and probably
  intended to include it here. In Tusc. 1, 34 Cic. reckons three ages
  <i>pueritia adulescentia senectus</i> as here; below in <a
  href="#Sect_74">74</a>, four periods, or five. &mdash;
  <b>quamvis</b>: = <i>quantumvis</i>. &mdash; <b>effluxisset</b>:
  subjunctive because the mood of <i>posset</i>, to which it stands in
  subordinate relation <i>Cum</i> here is purely temporal. See Roby, 1778;
  A. 342; G. 666; H. 529, II. &mdash; <b>posset</b>: see <a
  href="#Snot_3">n.</a> on <i>esset</i> above, <a href="#Sect_3">3</a>.</p>

  <p><b><a name="Snot_5"></a><a href="#Sect_5">5.</a> si ... soletis ...
  sumus</b>: the apodosis and protasis do not exactly correspond; the sense
  really required is 'if that wisdom for which you admire me does exist, it
  lies in this', etc. &mdash; <b>utinam ... esset</b>: <i>esset</i> here
  gives a greater appearance of modesty than would been expressed by
  <i>sit</i>: 'would it were, as it certainly is not'. A. 267; G. 253; H.
  483, 2. &mdash; <b>cognomine</b>: Cato bore the title <i>sapiens</i>,
  even in his lifetime; see <a href="#Page_xx">Introd</a>. <i>Cognomen</i> is used in good Latin
  to denote both the family name and the acquired by-name; in late Latin
  this latter is denoted by <i>agnomen</i>. &mdash; <b>in hoc
  sapientes</b>: but above, <a href="#Sect_4">4</a> <i>rerum
  sapientiam</i>, not <i>in rebus</i>. The genitive construction is not
  found with <i>sapiens</i> used as noun or adjective till late Latin
  times. &mdash; <b>naturam ducem</b> etc.: Cato's claim to the title of
  <i>sapiens</i> does not rest on any deep knowledge of philosophy, but on
  practical wisdom or common sense and experience in affairs. Cf. Lael. 6
  and 19. In this passage Cicero has put into Cato's mouth phrases borrowed
  from the Stoic philosophy, which declared the life of virtue to be life
  in accordance with nature (<i>naturae convenienter vivere</i> or
  <span
  lang="el" title="homologoumenôs tê physei zên">&#x201B;&#x3BF;&#x3BC;&#x3BF;&#x3BB;&#x3BF;&#x3B3;&#x3BF;&#x3C5;&#x3BC;&#x3B5;&#x3BD;&#x3C9;&#x3C2;
  &#x3C4;&#x3B7; &#x3C6;&#x3C5;&#x3C3;&#x3B5;&#x3B9;
  &#x3B6;&#x3B7;&#x3BD;</span>). Cf.
  <a href="#Sect_71">71</a>, <a href="#Snot_71">n.</a> on <i>secundum
  naturam</i>. &mdash; <b>tamquam deum</b>: observe <i>deum</i> not
  <i>deam</i>, because nature is compared with, and not identified with, a
  divine being. Cf. Fin. 5, 43 <i>eam (rationem) quasi deum ducem
  subsequens</i>. &mdash; <b>aetatis</b>: here = <i>vitae</i>, life as a
  whole. Cf. <a href="#Sect_2">2</a> <i>omne tempus aetatis</i> and <a
  href="#Snot_82">n.</a>; also <a href="#Sect_13">13</a> <i>aetatis ...
  senectus</i>; <a href="#Sect_33">33</a>, <a href="#Sect_64">64</a>, <a
  href="#Sect_82">82</a>. &mdash; <b>descriptae</b>: 'composed'; literally
  'written out'. The reading <i>discriptae</i>, which many editions give,
  does not so well suit the passage. <i>Discribere</i> is to map out, plan,
  arrange, put in order (see <a href="#Sect_59">59</a> <i>discripta</i> and
  <i>discriptio</i>); the point here lies, however, not in the due
  arrangement of the different scenes of a play, but in the careful working
  out of each scene. <i>Ab ea</i> must be supplied after <i>descriptae</i>
  from <i>a qua</i> above. &mdash; <b>actum</b>: the common comparison of
  life with a drama is also found in <a href="#Sect_64">64</a>, <a
  href="#Sect_70">70</a>, <a href="#Sect_85">85</a>. &mdash; <b>inerti</b>:
  the sense of 'ignorant' 'inartistic' (<i>in, ars</i>), has been given to
  this by some editors (cf. Hor. Ep. 2, 2, 126 <i>praetulerim scriptor
  delirus inersque videri</i>, and Cic. Fin. 2, 115 <i>artes, quibus qui
  carebant, inertes a maioribus nominabantur</i>), but the meaning
  'inactive', 'lazy', 'slovenly' seems to suit <i>neglectum</i> better.
  &mdash; <b>poeta</b>: nature is here the dramatist, the drama is life,
  the actors are human beings. &mdash; <b>sed tamen</b> etc.: 'but
  for all that it was inevitable that there should be something with the
  nature of an end'. So <a href="#Sect_69">69</a> <i>in quo est aliquid
  extremum</i>, <a href="#Sect_43">43</a> <i>aliquid pulchrum</i>. &mdash;
  <b>arborum bacis</b>: the word <i>baca</i> (the spelling <i>bacca</i> has
  little or no authority) is applied to all fruits growing on bushes or
  trees, cf. Tusc. 1, 31 <i>arbores seret diligens agricola, quarum aspiciet
  bacam ipse numquam</i>. &mdash; <b>terraeque fructibus</b>: here = cereals,
  roots, vegetables and small fruits. No sharp distinction can be drawn
  between <i>fruges</i> and <i>fructus</i> (<i>e.g.</i> in Div. 1, 116 we
  have <i>fruges terrae bacasve arborum</i>) though <i>fructus</i> as
  commonly used is the more general word of the two. &mdash; <b>maturitate
  caducum</b>: 'a time of senility, so to speak and readiness to drop, that
  comes of a seasonable ripeness'. <i>Vietus</i> is literally 'twisted' or
  bent', being originally the passive participle of <i>viere</i>. The
  comparison of old age with the ripeness of fruit recurs in <a
  href="#Sect_71">71</a>. Cf. Plin. Ep. 5, 14, 5 <i>non tam aetatis maturitate
  quam vitae</i>. &mdash; <b>ferundum</b>: the form in <i>undus</i> is
  archaic, and generally used by Cic. in quoting or imitating passages of
  laws, sacred formulae, and the like. H 239. &mdash; <b>molliter</b>: here
  'gently', 'with resignation', though <i>molliter ferre</i> often has
  another meaning, viz. to bear pain or trouble in an <i>unmanly</i>
  fashion. Cf. <i>facillime ferre</i> below. &mdash; <b>quid est aliud</b>
  etc. The words perhaps imply the rationalistic explanation of myths which
  the Greeks had begun to teach to the Romans during Cato's lifetime. Trans
  'what else but resistance to nature is equivalent to warring against the
  gods, and <i>not</i> 'what else does warring with the gods mean but to
  resist nature.' In comparisons of this sort the Latins generally put the
  things compared in a different order from that required by English idiom.
  Thus in Div. 2, 78 <i>quid est aliud nolle moneri a Iove nisi efficere ut
  aut ne fieri possit auspicium aut, si fiat, videri</i>, S. Rosc. 54 <i>quid
  est aliud iudicio ac legibus ac maiestate vestra abuti ad quaestum ac
  libidinem nisi hoc modo accusare</i>.  Phil. 1, 22, 2, 7, 5, 5, 10, 5.
  &mdash; <b>Gigantum modo</b>: see <a href="#Snot_4">n. on 4</a> <i>Aetna
  gravius</i> &mdash; <b>dis</b>: for the form <i>dis</i> see <a
  href="#Snot_25">n. on 25</a>.</p>

  <p><b><a name="Snot_6"></a><a href="#Sect_6">6.</a> atqui</b>: in the best
  Latin <i>atqui</i> does not introduce a statement <i>contradicting</i>
  the preceding statement, but one that <i>supplements</i> it. Here it may
  be translated 'True, but'. Cf. <a href="#Sect_66">66</a>, <a
  href="#Sect_81">81</a>. &mdash; <b>gratissimum</b>: equivalent to <i>rem
  gratissimam</i>. With the thought cf. Rep. 1, 34 <i>gratum feceris si
  explicaris</i>. Lael. 16 <i>pergratum feceris si disputaris</i>. &mdash;
  <b>ut pollicear</b>: so Acad. 1, 33 <i>nos vero volumus ut pro Attico
  respondeam</i>. Brut. 122 <i>nobis vero placet, ut pro Bruto etiam
  respondeam</i>; Lael. 32 <i>tu vero perge, pro hoc enim
  respondeo</i> A 317, <i>c</i>, H 499, 2, n. &mdash; <b>senes fieri</b>: if
  the infinitive had depended on <i>speramus</i> alone and <i>volumus</i>
  had not intervened, Cicero would probably have written <i>nos futuros
  esse senes</i>. &mdash; <b>multo ante</b>: <i>sc. quam id factum erit</i>
  so Balb 41 <i>re denique multo ante (sc. quam factum est) audita</i>, and
  very often in Cicero. &mdash; <b>didicerimus</b>: as this corresponds with
  <i>feceris,</i>it would have been formally correct to write here <i>nos
  docueris</i>. &mdash; <b>quibus possimus</b>: 'what considerations will
  enable us most easily to support the growing burden of age'. &mdash;
  <b>futurum est</b>: = <span lang="el" title="mellei einai">&#x3BC;&#x3B5;&#x3BB;&#x3BB;&#x3B5;&#x3B9;
  &#x3B5;&#x3B9;&#x3BD;&#x3B1;&#x3B9;</span> this form of the future is used in
  preference to the simple <i>erit</i> because it is desired to represent
  the event as <i>on the very point of fulfilment</i>, and therefore sure
  of fulfilment. <i>Erit</i> would have implied much less certainty. Trans.
  'I will do so if my action <i>is going to give</i> you pleasure'. Cf. <a
  href="#Sect_67">67</a> <i>beatus futurus sum</i>, also <a
  href="#Sect_81">81</a>, <a href="#Sect_85">85</a>. See Roby, 1494. &mdash;
  <b>nisi molestum est</b>: a common expression of courtesy, like <a
  href="#Sect_15">15</a> <i>nisi alienum putas, si placet</i>, cf. Hor. Sat.
  2, 8, 4 <i>si grave non est</i>. &mdash; <b>tamquam longam viam</b>: Cicero
  here puts into Laelius' mouth almost the very words addressed by Socrates
  to the aged Cephalus in the introduction to Plato's Republic, 328 E.
  Observe the succession of similar sounds in t<i>am</i>qu<i>am</i>,
  aliqu<i>am</i>, long<i>am</i>, vi<i>am</i>. &mdash; <b>viam confeceris</b>
  so pro Quint. 79 <i>conficere</i> DCC <i>milia passuum, conficere iter</i>
  a common phrase. For mood see A 312, G 604, H 513, II. &mdash; <b>quam
  ... ingrediundum sit</b>: this construction, the neuter of the gerundive
  with <i>est</i> followed by an accusative case, is exceedingly rare
  excepting in two writers, Lucretius and Varro. See the full list of
  examples given by Roby, Gram., Pref. to vol. 2, p LXXII. A 294, <i>c</i>, H
  371, I. 2, 2, n. The best texts of Cicero now give only one example of a
  construction at all resembling this, viz. pro Scauro 13 <i>obliviscendum
  vobis putatis matrum in liberos, virorum in uxores scelera?</i> The
  supposition of some scholars, that in this passage Cic. used the
  construction in imitation of the archaic style of Cato, is not likely to
  be true, seeing that in Cato's extant works the construction does not
  once occur. For the form <i>undum</i> see <a href="#Snot_5">n. on 5</a>
  <i>ferundum</i>. &mdash; <b>istuc</b>: not adverb, but neuter pronoun, as
  in <a href="#Sect_8">8</a>. The kind of construction, <i>istuc videre
  quale sit</i> for <i>videre quale istuc sit</i>, is especially common in
  Cicero.</p>

  <p><b><a name="Snot_7"></a><a href="#Sect_7">7.</a> faciam ut potero</b>
  'I will do it as well as I can.'   Observe the future <i>potero</i> where
  English idiom would require a present. So Rep. 1, 38 <i>hic Scipio, faciam
  quod voltis, ut potero</i>. &mdash; <b>saepe enim</b>: <i>enim</i>
  introduces a reason, not for the words <i>ut potero</i>, but for
  <i>faciam</i> &mdash; 'I will grant your request because I have often
  heard complaints about old age and therefore have thought of the matter.'
  &mdash; <b>pares autem</b> etc.: parenthetical. &mdash; <b>vetere

  <p><b>P. <a href="#Page_4">4</a> &mdash; facillime</b>: 'most
  cheerfully', 'most eagerly'; a common meaning of the word in Cic.,
  <i>e.g.</i> Fam. 2, 16, 2 <i>in maritimis facillime sum</i>, <i>i.e.</i>
  'I find most pleasure in staying by the sea'. &mdash; <b>quae</b>: a kind
  of explanation of <i>querellis</i>. &mdash; 'lamentations, viz. such
  utterances as' etc.; see n. on Lael. 14 <i>quae</i>; cf. Fam. 2, 8, 2
  <i>sermonibus de re publica ... quae nec possunt scribi nec scribenda
  sunt</i>. A. 199, <i>b</i>; G. 616, 3, I.; H. 445, 5. &mdash; <b>C.
  Salinator</b>: probably C. Livius Salinator, praetor in 191 B.C. (Livy
  35, 24), who was entrusted with the equipment of the Roman fleets during
  the war against Antiochus. He was born about 230, and was therefore a
  little younger than Cato; cf. <i>fere aequales</i> below. Salinator was
  consul in 188, and died in 170. For the name Salinator cf. <a
  href="#Snot_11">n. on 11</a>. &mdash; <b>Sp. Albinus</b>: Sp. Postumius
  Albinus was consul in 186, and was with his colleague appointed to
  investigate the great Bacchanalian conspiracy of that year (Livy 39, CC.
  1 seq.). Albinus died in 180. He was probably a little younger than
  Salinator. He can scarcely have been fifty years of age at his death.
  &mdash; <b>tum ... tum</b>: 'now ... again'; so in <a
  href="#Sect_45">45</a>. &mdash; <b>carerent</b>: see <a href="#Snot_3">n.
  on 3</a> <i>ferat</i>. &mdash; <b>vitam nullam putarent</b>: 'they
  considered life to be not life at all'. For <i>vitam nullam</i> cf. Lael.
  86 <i>sine amicitia vitam esse nullam</i>; also the Greek phrase
  <span lang="el"
  title="bios abiôtos">&#x3B2;&#x3B9;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;
  &#x3B1;&#x3B2;&#x3B9;&#x3C9;&#x3C4;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span>; and below, <a
  href="#Sect_77">77</a> <i>vitam quae est sola vita nominanda</i>; also
  82. A. 239; H. 373, 1, n. 2. <i>Putarent</i> = 'thought, as they said'.
  &mdash; <b>id quod esset accusandum</b>: the subjunctive <i>esset</i> is
  used because a <i>class</i> of things is referred to, 'nothing of a
  nature to deserve complaint'; <i>id quod erat</i>, etc. would have meant
  merely 'that one thing which was matter for complaint'. A. 320; G. 634,
  Rem. 1; H. 503, I. &mdash; <b>usu venirent</b>: the phrase <i>usu
  venire</i> differs very little in meaning from <i>accidere</i>.
  <i>Usu</i> is commonly explained as an ablative ('in practice', 'in
  experience'), but is quite as likely to be a dative of the sort generally
  called predicative ('to come as matter of experience'); cf. Verg. Aen. 1,
  22 <i>venire excidio</i>; Plin. N.H. 28, 106 <i>odio</i>; Caes. B.G. 5,
  27 <i>subsidio</i>. &mdash; <b>quorum ... multorum</b>: the first
  genitive is dependent on the second, so that <i>quorum = e quibus</i>.
  Notice the separation of <i>quorum</i> from <i>multorum</i> and
  of <i>multorum</i> from <i>senectutem</i>. &mdash; <b>sine querella</b>:
  attribute of <i>senectutem</i>. A. 217, Rem.; H. 359, n. 1, 4), and n. 3.
  This form of attributive phrase, consisting of a preposition with a noun,
  is common; cf. <a href="#Sect_24">24</a> <i>ex agro Sabino rusticos
  Romanos</i>; <a href="#Sect_40">40</a> <i>cum hostibus clandestina
  colloquia</i>. <i>Querella</i> is better spelling than <i>querela</i>.
  See Roby, 177, 2. &mdash; <b>qui</b>: 'men of such nature as to ...'
  &mdash; <b>et ... nec</b>: Roby 2241. The reason for the departure from
  the ordinary sequence of particles lies in the words <i>non moleste</i>.
  <i>Nec ...et </i> is common; see <a href="#Sect_51">51</a>, <a
  href="#Sect_53">53</a>. &mdash; <b>libidinum vinculis</b> etc.: Cic. is
  here thinking of the conversation between Socrates and Cephalus in Plato,
  Rep. 329 D, for which see <a href="#Page_viii">Introd</a>. &mdash; <b>moderati</b>:
  'self-controlled'; cf. <a href="#Snot_1">n. on 1</a> <i>moderationem</i>;
  <i>difficiles</i>, 'peevish'; <i>inhumani</i>, 'unkindly';
  <i>importunitas</i>, 'perversity'. <i>Importunitas</i> seems to be used
  as the substantive corresponding in sense with the adjective
  <i>difficilis</i>. <i>Difficultas</i>, in the sense of 'peevishness',
  probably occurs only in Mur. 19.</p>

  <p><b><a name="Snot_8"></a><a href="#Sect_8">8.</a> dixerit quispiam</b>:
  'some one will say presently'; a gentle way of introducing one's own
  objection. The mood of <i>dixerit</i> is probably indicative, not
  subjunctive; see the thorough discussion in Roby, Gram., Vol. 2, Pref.,
  p. CIV. <i>et seq</i>. &mdash; <b>opes et copias</b>: 'resources and
  means'. <i>Opes</i> has a wider meaning than <i>copias</i> (mere material
  wealth) and includes all sources of power, influence, and authority as
  well as wealth. Thus in Lael. 22 the end of <i>divitiae</i> is said to be
  enjoyment; of <i>opes</i>, worship (<i>opes ut colare</i>).
  <i>Dignitas</i> is social position. &mdash; <b>id</b>: remark the
  singular pronoun, which indicates that the preceding clause is now taken
  as conveying one idea. Trans. 'such fortune'. &mdash; <b>contingere</b>:
  'to fall to one's lot' is the phrase in English which most closely
  represents <i>contingere</i>. This verb is not, as is often assumed, used
  merely of <i>good</i> fortune; it implies in itself nothing concerning
  the <i>character</i> of events, whether they be good or bad, but simply
  that the events take place <i>naturally</i> and were to be expected. See
  n. on Lael. 8, where the word is distinctly used in connection with
  <i>bad</i> fortune, as it is, strikingly, in <a href="#Sect_71">71</a>
  below. &mdash; <b>est ... omnia</b>: 'your statement indeed amounts to
  something, but it by no means comprises every consideration'. The phrase
  <i>esse aliquid</i>, 'to be of some importance', is often used by Cic.
  both of things and of persons; cf. Tusc. 5, 104 <i>eos aliquid esse</i>,
  also <a href="#Snot_17">n. on 17</a> <i>nihil afferunt</i>. So <i>esse
  aliquis</i> of persons, as in the well-known passage of Iuvenal, 1, 72
  <i>aude aliquid brevibus Gyaris et carcere dignum si vis esse
  aliquis</i>. For the general sense cf. Tusc. 3, 52 <i>est id quidem
  magnum, sed non sunt in hoc omnia</i>; so De Or. 2, 215;
  ib. 3, 221; Leg. 2, 24 <i>in quo sunt omnia</i>. &mdash; <b>isto</b>: the
  use of the neuter pronoun in the oblique case as substantive is
  noticeable. &mdash; <b>Themistocles etc.</b>: Cicero borrows the story
  from Plato (Rep. 329 E <i>et seq</i>.), but it was first told by
  Herodotus, 8, 125 who gave a somewhat different version. Themistocles had
  received great honors at Sparta when Athenian ambassador there; an
  envious man declaring that the honors were paid really to Athens and not
  to Themistocles, the statesman answered <span lang="el"

  &#x391;&#x3B8;&#x3B7;&#x3BD;&#x3B1;&#x3B9;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span>. &mdash;
  <b>Seriphio</b>: Seriphus is a small island belonging to the Cyclad group
  and lying almost due N. of Melos, and due E. of the Scyllaean promontory.
  Seriphus is often taken by ancient writers as a specimen of an
  insignificant community (<i>e.g.</i> Aristoph. Acharn. 542; Cic. N.D. 1,
  88), but it had the honor of being one of the three island states which
  refused to give earth and water to the Persian envoys, the other two
  being the adjacent islands of Melos and Siphnus (Herodotus, 8, 46).
  &mdash; <b>iurgio</b>: <i>iurgium</i> is a quarrel which does not go
  beyond words; <i>rixa</i> a quarrel where the disputants come to blows.
  &mdash; <b>si ego</b>: but further on, <i>tu si</i>. The contrast would
  certainly be more perfect if <i>ego si</i> were read, as has been
  proposed, in place of <i>si ego</i>. &mdash; <b>quod eodem modo ...
  dici</b>: Cic. commonly says <i>quod ita dicendum</i> and the like; see
  <a href="#Snot_35">n. on 35</a> <i>quod ni ita fuisset</i>. Cato means
  that just as Themistocles' success was due to two things, his own
  character and his good fortune, so two things are necessary to make old
  age endurable, viz. moderate fortune and wisdom. He then in <a
  href="#Sect_9">9</a> insists that of these two conditions wisdom is far
  the more important. &mdash; <b>nec ... levis ... nec ... non gravis</b>:
  notice the chiasmus.</p>

  in a strongly affirmative sense, as in <a href="#Sect_76">76</a>; but in
  <a href="#Sect_28">28</a> (where see <a href="#Snot_28">n.</a>) it is
  concessive. &mdash; <b>cum diu multumque vixeris</b>: literally 'when you
  have lived long and much', <i>i.e.</i> when you have not only had a long
  life but have done a great deal in the course of it. The phrases <i>diu
  multumque, multum et diu</i> are common in Cic., as below, 38; Acad. 1,
  4; Div. 2, 1; Off 1, 118; Leg. Agr. 2, 88; De Or. 1, 152. For mood see A.
  309, a; H. 518, 2. &mdash; <b>ecferunt</b>: <i>ecferunt</i> for
  <i>efferunt</i> (<i>ec</i> = <i>ex</i> = <i>ecs</i>; so
  <span lang="el"
  title="ek">&#x3B5;&#x3BA;</span> = <span lang="el"
  title="ex">&#x3B5;&#x3BE;</span> =

  forms of the sort, as below, 39 <i>ecfrenate</i>, according to the
  evidence of the best MSS., occur in a good many passages. See Neue,
  Formenlehre, Vol. 2, pp. 766 seq., ed. 2. &mdash; <b>numquam
  deserunt</b>: the omission of the object after <i>deserunt</i> is not
  common. With the general sense of this passage cf. Arch. 16 <i>litterarum
  studia adulescentiam alunt, senectutem oblectant, secundas res ornant,
  adversis perfugium ac solarium praebent, delectant domi, non impediunt

  <p><b>P. <a href="#Page_5">5</a> &mdash; <a name="Snot_10"></a><a
  href="#Sect_10">10.</a> Q. Maximum</b>: the famous Q. Fabius Maximus
  Verrucosus Ovicula Cunctator, hero of the Second Punic War. &mdash;
  <b>eum ... recepit</b>: this clause has often been suspected to be an
  insertion of the writers of MSS. But (1) the capture of Tarentum in 209
  B.C. was Fabius' crowning achievement, and 'captor of Tarentum' was often
  added to his name as a title of honor; see De Orat. 2, 273; and (2) there
  were several other persons of distinction bearing the name Q. Maximus
  about the same time, so that some special mark was wanted for the sake of
  clearness. Notice <i>recepit</i> 'recovered', Tarentum having been lost
  by the Romans to Hannibal in 212 B.C. &mdash; <b>senem adulescens</b>:
  observe the emphasis given by placing close together the two words of
  opposite meaning. &mdash; <b>erat ... gravitas</b>: 'that hero possessed
  dignity tempered by courtesy'. Expressions like <i>erat in illo
  gravitas</i> are common in Cicero; <i>e.g.</i> Mur. 58 <i>erat in Cotta
  summa eloquentia.</i> The metaphor in <i>cond&#299;ta</i>, 'seasoned', is
  also common; cf. Lael. 66 <i>condimentum amicitiae</i>. &mdash;
  <b>quamquam</b>: 'though indeed', introducing a necessary correction of
  the last words <i>nec senectus mores mutaverat.</i> For this corrective
  <i>quamquam</i> cf. <a href="#Snot_2">n. on 2</a>. &mdash; <b>consul
  primum</b>: B.C. 233. &mdash; <b>grandem natu</b>: although the phrases
  <i>maior, maximus, parvus, minor, minimus natu</i> are of frequent
  occurrence, yet <i>magnus natu</i> is not Latin, <i>grandis natu</i>
  being always used instead. The historians sometimes use <i>magno natu
  esse</i> or <i>in magno natu esse</i>. &mdash; <b>anno post</b>: the word
  <i>unus</i> is not usually attached to <i>annus</i> except where there is
  a strong contrast between one and a larger number of years. <i>Anno
  post</i> must not be translated 'during the year after'; but either 'a
  year after', <i>anno</i> being regarded as the ablative of measure or
  excess, literally 'later by a year', or 'at the end of a year', the
  ablative being one of limitation, and <i>fuerat</i> being equivalent to
  <i>factus erat</i> 'had been elected'. So <i>quinto anno</i> below, 'at
  the end of the fifth year', <i>i.e.</i> 'five years after'. &mdash;
  <b>adulescentulus miles</b>: See <a href="#Snot_21">n. on 21</a>
  <i>quemquam senem.</i> Translate 'when quite a youth I marched with him
  to Capua as a private soldier'. G. 324; H. 363, 3, 2). <i>Miles</i> here
  = <i>gregarius miles</i>. &mdash; <b>quem
  magistratum</b>: <i>sc. quaesturam</i>, to be understood from
  <i>quaestor</i> Cf. Mur. 18 <i>quaesturam una petiit et sum ego factus
  (sc. quaestor) prior</i>. &mdash; <b>Tuditano et Cethego</b>: when the
  <i>praenomina</i> of the consuls are given the names generally stand side
  by side without <i>et</i>; when they are omitted <i>et</i> is generally
  inserted. Cf. <a href="#Snot_50">n. on 50</a> <i>Centone Tuditanoque,
  etc.</i> &mdash; <b>cum quidem</b>: the <i>quidem</i> simply adds a
  slight emphasis to <i>cum</i>; 'at the very time when',
  <span lang="el" title="epeidê ge">&#x3B5;&#x3C0;&#x3B5;&#x3B9;&#x3B4;&#x3B7; &#x3B3;&#x3B5;</span>. &mdash;
  <b>suasor</b>: <i>suasor legis</i> was any person who publicly
  (<i>i.e.</i> before the senate or people in <i>contio</i> assembled)
  spoke in favor of a measure, <i>dissuasor</i> any one who spoke against
  it. Cf. <a href="#Sect_14">14</a> <i>suasissem</i>. &mdash; <b>legis
  Cinciae</b>: a law passed in 204 B.C. by M. Cincius Alimentus, a plebeian
  tribune, whereby advocates were forbidden to take fees from their
  clients, and certain limitations were placed on gifts of property by
  private persons. &mdash; <b>cum ... esset</b>: '<i>though</i> he was'; so
  below <a href="#Sect_11">11</a>, <a href="#Sect_30">30</a>, etc. &mdash;
  <b>grandis</b>: = <i>grandis natu</i>. &mdash; <b>iuveniliter</b>:
  Hannibal was 29 years of age when he entered Italy in 218. &mdash;
  <b>exsultantem</b>: 'wildly roaming'. The word in its literal sense is
  used of a horse galloping at its own will over a plain. The metaphorical
  use is common in Cicero; cf. Acad. 2, 112 <i>cum sit campus in quo
  exsultare possit oratio, cur eam tantas in angustias compellimus?</i>
  &mdash; <b>patientia</b>: 'endurance', 'persistence'; it is not
  equivalent to our 'patience'. &mdash; <b>praeclare</b>: <i>sc. dicit</i>;
  cf. <a href="#Snot_3">n. on 3</a>. &mdash; <b>familiaris</b>: see <a href="#Page_xiii">Introd</a>.
  &mdash; <b>unus homo</b> etc.: these lines were famous, and were not only
  often quoted with the name of Ennius attached (as in Off. 1, 84; Livy 30,
  26), but also imitated or adapted without mention of his name, as, being
  too familiar to need it; cf. Att. 2, 19, 2; Ovid, Fast. 2, 241; Verg.
  Aen. 6, 846; Suet. Tib. 21. &mdash; <b>cunctando</b>: Cf. Polybius 3,
  105, 8. On Fabius' military policy consult Mommsen, Hist. of Rome, Bk.
  III. ch. 5. &mdash; <b>rem</b>: here = <i>rem publicam</i>. &mdash;
  <b>noenum</b>: the older form from which <i>non</i> is an abbreviation; =
  <i>ne-oinom</i>, <i>n-oinom</i>, literally 'not one thing'; cf.
  <i>nihil</i> = <i>ne-hilum</i> 'not a whit', also the rare word
  <i>ningulus</i> = <i>ne oinculus</i>, 'not even a little one'. &mdash;
  <b>rumores</b>: 'fame', 'public opinion'. &mdash; <b>poneb&#257;t</b>:
  for the long vowel cf. <a href="#Snot_1">n. on 1</a>, l. 2 <i>versat</i>.
  &mdash; <b>plusque</b>: MSS. <i>postque</i>; <i>plusque</i>is the
  emendation of Bernays. <i>Plusque magisque</i> is a variation upon the
  ordinary phrases <i>plus plusque</i>, <i>magis magisque</i>.</p>

  <p><b><a name="Snot_11"></a><a href="#Sect_11">11.</a> Salinatori</b>:
  there can be no doubt that Cicero is guilty of a blunder here, and in De
  Or. 2, 273 where the story also occurs. Livy (27, 34, 7) gives M. Livius
  Macatus as the name of the Roman commander who held the citadel
  of Tarentum while Hannibal was in possession of the town. Cicero probably
  found the commander described by the annalists merely as M. Livius (so in
  Livy 24, 20, 13; 26, 39, 1), and then jumped to tne conclusion that he
  was the famous M. Livius Salinator. This man, the father of the Salinator
  mentioned in <a href="#Sect_7">7</a>, was consul in 219 and subdued the
  Illyrians, but was condemned for misappropriation of public moneys and
  went into exile. In 210 he was induced to return by the desire of the
  senate. In 207 he became consul with C. Claudius Nero, and defeated
  Hasdrubal in the great battle of the Metaurus. In 204 Livius was censor
  with Nero as his colleague, and won his name <i>Salinator</i> by imposing
  a tax on salt. The title was bestowed in ridicule, but clung to the family.
  Salinator was a relative of M. Livius Macatus. See Liv 27, 34, 7. &mdash;
  <b>ita dicenti</b> etc.: the anecdote is told by Livy, 27, 25, 5 and
  Plutarch, Fab. 23. Both, however, refer the story not to the time at
  which Tarentum was taken, but to the year after, when altercations about
  it took place in the senate. &mdash; <b>toga</b>: here put for 'civil
  life', the <i>toga</i> being replaced in time of war by the <i>sagum</i>.
  Cf. in Pisonem 73 <i>pacis est insigne et oti toga, contra autem arma
  tumultus atque belli;</i> De Or. 3, 167 <i>'togam', pro 'pace', 'arma',
  ac 'tela', pro 'bello'.</i> We have the same contrast between <i>arma</i>
  and <i>toga</i> in Cicero's own much-derided verse, <i>cedant arma togae,
  concedat laurea laudi</i>, which is defended by him, in Pis. 73 and Off.
  1, 77. &mdash; <b>consul iterum</b> etc.: as the second consulship of
  Fabius was in 228 B.C., while the law of Flaminius was passed in 232
  (according to Polybius), it is very difficult to understand the statement
  here made. It is possible that Flaminius was one of the commissioners for
  executing his own law, and that its execution lasted over the time of
  Fabius' second consulship. The Flaminius here mentioned is the same who
  fell as consul in 217 at the battle of lake Trasimenus. He held large and
  statesman-like views on the policy of securing Italy by planting Romans
  and Latins in the territory then recently taken from the Gauls, in the
  neighborhood of Ariminum. This particular measure was carried against the
  will of the senate, and was the first law passed, since the <i>lex
  Hortensia</i> of 287, in defiance of its wishes. It was also the first
  agrarian law since the Licinio-Sextian law of 367. Polybius dates the
  decline of the Roman constitution from the passing of the <i>lex
  Flaminia</i>. Cf.'Rheinisches Museum', 1843, p. 573. &mdash; <b>Sp.
  Carvilio quiescente</b>: this Sp. Carvilius was consul in 234 when he
  conquered the Corsicans and Sardinians. In 228 he was again consul, and
  died as augur in 212. He is said, but erroneously, to have been the first
  Roman who divorced his wife. In 216, just after the battle of Cannae, he
  made a most remarkable proposal, to fill up the gaps which that battle
  had made in the numbers of the senate by selecting two members from each
  of the Latin communities. It was almost the only occasion in the course
  of Roman history when anything like modern representative government was
  advocated. Carvilius was not sprung from one of the noble families, who
  for the most part monopolized the higher offices of state, it is
  therefore not surprising that he should have sympathized with Flaminius.
  &mdash; <b>contra senatus auctoritatem</b>: 'against the expressed wish
  of the senate' <i>Senatus auctoritas</i> is, strictly speaking, an
  opinion of the senate not formally embodied in a decree, <i>senatus
  consultum</i>. Cicero, in Invent. 2, 52 says Flaminius carried his law
  <i>contra voluntatem omnium optimatium</i>. &mdash; <b>dividenti</b>:
  'when he tried to divide'. The participle is here equivalent to
  <i>cum</i> with the imperfect indicative (dividebat). So in <a
  href="#Sect_54">54</a> <i>lenientem</i> A. 290, <i>a</i>; G 668; H 549,
  1.</p>

  <p><b>P. <a href="#Page_6">6</a> &mdash; cum esset</b>: '<i>though</i> he
  was'. What Fabius declared was reaily that the <i>auspicia</i> were a
  political instrument in the hands of the aristocrats, rather than a part
  of religion. Fabius, according to Liv. 30, 26, 7, was augur for 62 years
  before his death, and had no doubt had a large experience in the
  manipulation of the <i>auspicia</i> for political purposes. Compare
  Homer, Iliad, 12, 243, also Cic. Phil. 11, 28 <i>Iuppiter ipse sanxit ut
  omnia quae rei publicae salutaria essent legitima et iusta
  haberentur</i>. Consult Mommsen, Hist of Rome, Bk. IV. Ch. 12.</p>

  <p><b><a name="Snot_12"></a><a href="#Sect_12">12.</a> admirabilius</b>:
  'more amazing'. The Latin word has a much stronger meaning than the
  English word derived from it. &mdash; <b>quo modo tulit</b>: = <i>eum
  modum quo tulit</i>, so that the clause is not really dependent on
  <i>cognovi</i>, nor <i>tulit</i> irregularly put for <i>tulerit</i>. In
  Lael. 9 Laelius exclaims, of Cato himself, <i>quo modo, ut alia omittam,
  mortem fili tulit</i>. And no doubt Cic. meant here to make Cato allude
  to <i>his</i> loss, described in <a href="#Sect_84">84</a>. &mdash;
  <b>fili</b>: see n. on 1 <i>praemi</i>. &mdash; <b>consularis</b>: the son
  of Fabius was consul in 213 with Ti. Sempronius Gracchus. &mdash; <b>est
  in manibus</b>: 'is in every one's hands', 'is commonly read'. The
  expression is common enough in this sense; <i>e.g.</i> Lael. 96 <i>in
  manibus est oratio</i>. &mdash; <b>laudatio</b>: <i>sc. funebris</i>, the
  funeral speech. This composition was read in Cicero's time (see Tusc. 3,
  70; Fam. 4, 6, 1) and existed in the time of
  Plutarch. See Plutarch's life of Fab. 24. &mdash; <b>quem
  philosophum</b>: many of the ancient philosophers wrote popular treatises
  in which the principles of philosophy were applied to the alleviation of
  sorrow. The most famous of these in Cicero's time was Crantor's
  <span lang="el" title="peri penthous">&#x3C0;&#x3B5;&#x3C1;&#x3B9;
  &#x3C0;&#x3B5;&#x3BD;&#x3B8;&#x3BF;&#x3C5;&#x3C2;</span>, which Cicero used
  largely in writing his <i>Tusculan Disputations</i>, and also in his
  <i>De Consolatione</i> on the death of his daughter. &mdash; <b>in luce
  ... civium</b>: 'in public and under the gaze of his fellow-countrymen'.
  Do not translate <i>in oculis</i> by the English phrase 'in the eyes of',
  which has another sense. The metaphor in <i>lux</i> is often used by
  Cicero, as Qu. Fr. 1, 1, 7 <i>in luce Asiae, in oculis provinciae</i>.
  &mdash; <b>notitia</b>: <i>notitia</i> is general knowledge, often merely
  the result of superficial observation; <i>scientia</i> is thorough
  knowledge, the result of elaboration and generalization. &mdash;
  <b>multae litterae</b>: 'great literary attainments.' In this sense
  <i>magnae</i> could not be used to represent 'great'. Note the ellipsis
  of <i>erant</i>. &mdash; <b>ut in homine Romano</b>: 'considering that he
  was a Roman', or 'for a Roman'. On the backwardness of the Romans in
  literary pursuits see Teuffel, Hist. of Rom. Lit, § 2; cf. also Ritter,
  Hist. of Ancient Philosophy, Vol. IV. pp. 1-13, Eng. ed. In parenthetic
  clauses like this, the introductory <i>ut</i> may convey two very
  different meanings according to the context. Thus in Acad. 2, 98 <i>homo
  acutus, ut Poenus</i> is 'a keen witted man, <i>as might be expected
  of</i> a Carthaginian' (cf. Colum. 1, 3, 8 <i>acutissimam gentem
  Poenos</i>) while Nepos, Epam. 5, 2 <i>exercitatum in dicendo ut
  Thebanum</i> implies that oratory was <i>not</i> to be expected of a
  Theban. &mdash; <b>domestica ... externa bella</b>: here the <i>domestica
  bella</i> are those wars which belong to the history of Rome, the
  <i>externa bella</i> those wars which belong to the history of other
  states; but usually <i>domestica bella</i> are civil wars, <i>externa</i>
  foreign wars in which Rome is engaged; <i>e.g.</i> Leg. agr. 2, 90
  <i>omnibus domesticis externisque bellis</i>; in Catil 2, 11 <i>omnia
  sunt externa unius virtute pacata; domesticum bellum manet, intus
  insidiae sunt</i>. The practice of reading military history was common
  among Roman commanders; see for instance Acad. 2, 3 of Lucullus; the
  practice is ridiculed by Marius in Sall. Iug. 85. &mdash; <b>ita</b>:
  <i>ita</i> does not qualify <i>cupide</i>, and has not the sense of
  <i>tam</i>, it means rather 'in this state', 'under these conditions';
  the words from <i>quasi</i> to the end of the sentence really form an
  explanation of <i>ita</i>. This mode of expression is often found,
  <i>ita</i> and <i>sic</i> frequently look on to clauses introduced by
  <i>quasi</i>, <i>si</i>, <i>ut</i>, <i>cum</i> etc. Cf. below <a
  href="#Sect_26">26</a> <i>sic quasi, cupiens</i> (where see <a
  href="#Snot_26">n.</a>); Sall. Iug. 85, 19 <i>ita aetatem agunt
  quasi vestros honores contemnunt, ita hos petunt quasi honeste
  vixerint</i>. &mdash; <b>divinarem</b>: see references on <a href="#Snot_6">6</a>
  <i>confeceris</i>. &mdash; <b>illo exstincto</b>: Fabius died in 203 B.C.
  &mdash; <b>fore unde discerem neminem</b>: cf. Acad. 1, 8 <i>quae nemo
  adhuc docuerat nec erat unde studiosi scire possent. Unde</i> of persons
  (here = <i>a quo</i>); is common in both verse and prose (so <span
  lang="el"
  title="hothen">&#x201B;&#x3BF;&#x3B8;&#x3B5;&#x3BD;</span> and
  <span
  lang="el"
  title="hothenper">&#x201B;&#x3BF;&#x3B8;&#x3B5;&#x3BD;&#x3C0;&#x3B5;&#x3C1;</span>, vid. Liddell and
  Scott in vv.); cf. Horace 1, 12, 17 <i>unde nil maius generatur ipso</i>;
  1, 28, 28; Cic. de Or. 1, 67 <i>ille ipse unde cognorit</i>; ib. 2, 285.
  So <i>ubi = apud quem</i> in Verr. 4, 29; <i>quo = ad quos</i> below, 83,
  and in Verr. 4 38; cf. also <a href="#Snot_47">n.</a> on <i>istinc</i> in
  47. For mood of <i>discerem</i> see A. 320; G.
  634; H. 503, I.</p>

  <p><b><a name="Snot_13"></a><a href="#Sect_13">13.</a> quorsus igitur
  haec</b>: <i>sc. dixi</i>. &mdash; <b>tam multa</b>: this takes the place
  of <i>tot</i>, which, like <i>quot</i>, cannot be used as a substantive.
  &mdash; <b>Scipiones</b>: 'men like Scipio', <i>i.e.</i> the elder
  Africanus; so 15 <i>Fabricii Curii Coruncanii</i>. Cicero has here put
  his own opinion of Scipio into the mouth of Cato, who, during a large
  part of his life, was a staunch and even bitter opponent of Scipio, and
  therefore not likely to couple him with Fabius. Cf. <a href="#Page_xiii">Introd</a>. &mdash; <b>ut
  ... recordentur</b>: the repetition of <i>ut</i> with each clause for the
  sake of effect may be compared with the repetition of <i>nihil</i> in <a
  href="#Sect_15">15</a>, <a href="#Sect_27">27</a>, <a
  href="#Sect_41">41</a>; of <i>non</i> in <a href="#Sect_32">32</a>; of
  <i>hinc</i> in <a href="#Sect_40">40</a>; of <i>sibi</i> in <a
  href="#Sect_58">58</a>. &mdash; <b>pedestris</b>: for <i>terrestris</i>;
  the usage is very common; so in Greek
  <span lang="el"
  title="pezomachia">&#x3C0;&#x3B5;&#x3B6;&#x3BF;&#x3BC;&#x3B1;&#x3C7;&#x3B9;&#x3B1;</span> and
  <span lang="el"

  title="pezomachein">&#x3C0;&#x3B5;&#x3B6;&#x3BF;&#x3BC;&#x3B1;&#x3C7;&#x3B5;&#x3B9;&#x3BD;</span>
  and <span lang="el"
  title="naumachein">&#x3BD;&#x3B1;&#x3C5;&#x3BC;&#x3B1;&#x3C7;&#x3B5;&#x3B9;&#x3BD;</span> are
  often contrasted (see Liddell and Scott). It is not recorded by
  historians that either Scipio or Fabius took part personally in naval
  warfare. &mdash; <b>recordentur</b>: this verb implies the habitual
  dwelling of the memory upon the past. &mdash; <b>quiete et pure atque
  eleganter</b>: the enumeration consists of two branches connected by
  <i>et</i>, the second branch being subdivided into two members connected
  by <i>atque</i>. Had each of the adverbs been intended to stand on
  exactly the same footing Cic. would have written <i>et</i> instead of
  <i>atque</i>, or else would have omitted the copula altogether; see <a
  href="#Snot_53">n. on 53</a> <i>capitum iugatio</i>. In enumerations of
  the form A + (B<sub>l</sub> + B<sub>2</sub>), the + outside the bracket
  is expressed by <i>et</i>, the + inside the bracket generally being
  expressed by <i>ac</i>, for which <i>atque</i> is substituted when the
  following word (<i>i.e.</i> B<sub>2</sub>) begins with a vowel, a
  guttural (<i>c, q, g</i>) or <i>h</i>, before which <i>ac</i> was very
  seldom written. &mdash; <b>pure atque eleganter</b>: 'sinlessly and
  gently'. <i>Pure</i> implies moral stainlessness, <i>eleganter</i>,
  literally 'in choice fashion', implies daintiness combined with
  simplicity in regard to the external conditions of life. The same ideas
  are put together in Sull. 79 <i>cum summa elegantia atque integritate
  vixistis</i>. &mdash; <b>aetatis</b>: see <a href="#Snot_5">n. on 5</a>.
  &mdash; <b>placida ac lenis</b>: 'quiet and mild'; <i>placida</i> refers
  to the external surroundings, <i>lenis</i> to the temper and character.
  &mdash; <b>accepimus</b>: <i>sc. fuisse</i>; for the ellipsis of the
  infinitive cf. <a href="#Snot_22">n. on 22</a> <i>videretur</i>. &mdash;
  <b>uno et octogesimo</b>: but below <i>quarto</i> (not <i>quattuor</i>)
  <i>nonagesimo</i>. In the compound <i>ordinal</i> numbers corresponding
  to those <i>cardinal</i> numbers which are made up of one and a multiple
  of ten, the Latins use <i>unus</i> oftener than <i>primus</i>, which
  would be strictly correct; so in English 'one and eightieth' for
  'eighty-first'. The ordinary Grammar rule (Roby, Vol. I, p. 443 'the
  <i>ordinal</i> not the <i>cardinal</i> is used in giving the date')
  requires slight correction. For the position of the words see G. 94, 3;
  H. 174, footnote 3. &mdash; <b>scribens est mortuus</b>: 'died while
  still engaged upon his works'; cf. <a href="#Sect_23">23</a> <i>num
  Platonem ... coegit in suis studiis obmutiscere senectus?</i> Diog.
  Laert. 3, 2 quoting Hermippus (a Greek writer of biography who lived
  about the time of the Second Punic war), says that Plato died in the
  middle of a marriage-feast at which he was a guest. Val. Max. 8, 7, 3
  gives a slightly different account. &mdash; <b>Isocrati</b>: this form of
  the genitive of Greek proper names in <i>-es</i> was probably used by
  Cicero rather than the form in <i>-is</i>; see Madvig on Fin. 1, 14;
  Neue, Formenlehre, 1² 332. Isocrates, the greatest teacher of rhetoric of
  his time, lived from 436 to 338, when he died by voluntary starvation
  owing to his grief at the loss of Greek freedom through the battle of
  Chaeronea. Milton, Sonnet X. 'That dishonest victory At Chaeronea, fatal
  to liberty, Kill'd with report that old man eloquent'. &mdash; <b>eum ...
  inscribitur</b>: the periphrasis is common, and the verb
  <i>inscribere</i> is nearly always in the present tense (in later prose
  as well as in Cicero) as in <a href="#Sect_59">59</a>. This is sometimes
  the case even where the neighboring verbs are in past tenses, as in Acad.
  1, 12 <i>nec se tenuit quin contra suum doctorem librum etiam ederet qui
  Sosus inscribitur</i>. The present seems to mean that the name mentioned
  is continually given to each copy of the book as produced; where the
  continuing multiplication of copies is not looked to, we have the
  perfect, as Att. 8, 5, 2 <i>tu fasciculum</i> (bundle of letters) <i>qui
  est inscriptus 'des M'. Curio', velim cures ad eum perferendum</i>. Cf.
  also De Or. 2, 61 <i>deceptus indicibus librorum qui sunt fere
  inscripti</i> ('to which the authors&mdash;once for all&mdash;have given
  the titles') <i>de virtute, de iustitia</i>, etc.; so Div. 2, 1 <i>eo
  libro qui inscriptus Hortensius</i>. &mdash; <b>dicit</b>: the
  'Panathenaicus', an encomium of Athens written for recitation at the
  great festival of the Panathenaea, is among the works of
  Isocrates which we still possess. In c. 1 Isocrates says
  <span lang="el" title="tois etesi enenêkonta kai tettarsin, hôn egô tynchanô gegonôs">&#x3C4;&#x3BF;&#x3B9;&#x3C2; &#x3B5;&#x3C4;&#x3B5;&#x3C3;&#x3B9;

  &#x3B3;&#x3B5;&#x3B3;&#x3BF;&#x3BD;&#x3C9;&#x3C2;</span>. &mdash;
  <b>vixitque</b>: 'and yet he lived'. The <i>que</i> here has a slight
  adversative force, as is often the case with <i>et</i>. Cf. <a
  href="#Snot_28">n. on 28</a>, <a href="#Sect_43">43</a>, <a
  href="#Sect_73">73</a>. &mdash; <b>Gorgias</b>: the greatest of the
  sophists, born at Leontini in Sicily about 485 B.C.; his death took
  place, according to the varying accounts, in 380, 378, or 377. In his old
  age he lived in Thessaly where Isocrates studied with him; see Or. 176;
  Fin. 2, 1. For the adjective <i>Leontinus</i> placed before the name
  rather than after cf. 43 <i>Thessalo Cinea</i>. &mdash; <b>centum et
  septem annos</b>: Kennedy, Gram., § 34, vii, <i>c</i>, says, 'in compound
  numbers above 100 the larger number, with or without <i>et</i>, generally
  precedes the smaller'; cf. Roby, Vol. 1 p. 443. &mdash; <b>cesso</b>:
  does not correspond in meaning with our 'cease', <i>i.e.</i> '<i>to come
  to</i> a standstill'; <i>cesso</i> is 'I am in a state of rest', 'I am
  idle'. &mdash; <b>quaereretur</b>: the past tense, though the principal
  verb <i>inquit</i>, is in the present, because the present is the
  <i>historical</i> present and so equivalent to a past tense. Cf. Roby,
  1511-1514; Kennedy 229, 2. A. 287, <i>e</i>; G. 511, Rem. 1; H. 495, II.
  The idiom by which the imperfect stands where we should expect a tense of
  completed action, should be noticed; cf. Tusc. 2, 60 <i>quem cum rogaret,
  respondit.</i> The explanation of the imperfect in such cases is that it
  marks out, more clearly than the pluperfect would, the fact that the
  action of the principal verb and the action of the dependent verb are
  practically contemporaneous. In our passage if <i>quaesitum esset</i> had
  been written it would have indicated merely that at some quite indefinite
  time after the question was put the answer was given. Cf. N.D. 1, 60
  <i>auctore ... obscurior</i>. &mdash; <b>cur ... vita</b>: a hint at
  suicide, which the ancients thought a justifiable mode of escape from
  troubles, particularly those of ill health or old age. See <a
  href="#Snot_73">n. on 73</a> <i>vetat Pythagoras. Esse in vita</i> is
  stronger than <i>vivere</i>; cf. Qu. Fr. 1, 3, 5. &mdash; <b>nihil habeo
  quod accusem</b>: 'I have no reason to reproach'. Cf. the common phrase
  <i>quid est quod ...? Quod</i>, adverbial acc. A. 240, <i>a</i>; G. 331,
  R. 3; H. 378, 2. For mood of <i>accusem</i> see H. 503, I. n. 2, and
  references on <a href="#Sect_12">12</a> <i>discerem</i>. &mdash;
  <b>praeclarum responsum</b>: <i>est</i> is not required, because
  <i>responsum</i> is in apposition to the last part of the preceding
  sentence. Similar appositions occur in Laelius, 67, 71, 79. &mdash;
  <b>docto</b>: applied especially to philosophers, but also to poets. The
  word implies <i>cultivation</i> as well as mere <i>knowledge</i>; 'a
  learned man', merely as such, is '<i>homo litteratus</i>'; cf. <a
  href="#Snot_54">n. on 54</a>.</p>

  <p><b>P. <a href="#Page_7">7</a> &mdash; <a name="Snot_14"></a><a

  Latin always expressed by a parenthesis like this and not by a participle
  in agreement with the noun. The phrases '<i>ante dictus</i>', '<i>supra
  dictus</i>', belong to silver Latin, where they are common. Cf. <a
  href="#Sect_23">23</a> <i>quos ante dixi</i>. &mdash; <b>sic ut</b> etc.:
  the lines are from the Annals of Ennius, for which see <a

  <i>uu</i>, nor most likely did Cicero; the former may have written either
  <i>ecus, equos,</i> or <i>equs</i>. The last form Vahlen prints in his
  edition of Ennius. &mdash; <b>spatio supremo</b>: 'at the end of the
  race-course', 'at the goal', or it may be 'at the last turn round the
  course', the race requiring the course to be run round several times; cf.
  Homer's <span lang="el" title="pymaton dromon">&#x3C0;&#x3C5;&#x3BC;&#x3B1;&#x3C4;&#x3BF;&#x3BD;

  an Olympic contest. So Horace Ep. 1, 1, 50 has <i>coronari Olympia</i> =
  <span lang="el" title="stephanousthai Olympia">&#x3C3;&#x3C4;&#x3B5;&#x3C6;&#x3B1;&#x3BD;&#x3BF;&#x3C5;&#x3C3;&#x3B8;&#x3B1;&#x3B9;
  &#x39F;&#x3BB;&#x3C5;&#x3BC;&#x3C0;&#x3B9;&#x3B1;</span>. The editors print
  <i>Olympia</i>, but the use of <i>y</i> to represent Greek
  <span
  lang="el" title="u">&#x3C5;</span> did not come in till long after the time of Ennius.
  &mdash; <b>senio</b>: differs from <i>senectute</i> in implying not
  merely old age, but the weakness which usually accompanies it. &mdash;
  <b>confectus</b>: for the disregard of the final <i>s</i> in scanning cf.
  <a href="#Snot_1">n. on 1</a>, l. 6. &mdash; <b>equi victoris</b>: for
  the almost adjectival use of the substantive <i>victor</i>, cf. Verg.
  Aen. 7, 656 <i>victores equos</i>; ib. 12, 751 <i>venator canis</i>; ib.
  10, 891; 11, 89, and Georg. 2, 145 <i>bellator equus</i>, in Theocritus

  &#x201B;&#x3B9;&#x3C0;&#x3C0;&#x3BF;&#x3B9;</span>. The feminine nouns in <i>-trix</i>
  are freely used as adjectives both in verse and in prose. A. 88,
  <i>c</i>; H. 441, 3. &mdash; <b>quem quidem</b>: the same form of
  transition is used in <a href="#Sect_26">26</a>, <a
  href="#Sect_29">29</a>, <a href="#Sect_46">46</a>, <a
  href="#Sect_53">53</a>. The whole of this passage to <i>suasissem</i> is
  an exhibition of antiquarian learning quite unnatural and inappropriate
  in a dialogue. &mdash; <b>probe meminisse potestis</b>: cf. De Or. 3, 194
  <i>quem tu probe meministi</i>; Fin. 2, 63 <i>L. Thorius quem meminisse
  tu non potes. Memini</i> can take a <i>personal</i> accusative only when
  the person who remembers was a contemporary of the person remembered;
  otherwise the gen. follows. Cf. Roby, 1333; A. 219, Rem.; H. 407, n. 1.
  &mdash; <b>hi consules</b>: 'the present consuls'. &mdash; <b>T.
  Flamininus</b>: commonly said to be the son of the great Flamininus (<a href="#Snot_1">1</a>,
  l. 1). He was altogether undistinguished, as also were the Acilius and
  the Caepio here mentioned. This passage gives the imagined date of the
  dialogue as 150 B.C. &mdash; <b>Philippo</b>: this was Q. Marcius
  Philippus, who was consul in 186 and took part in the suppression of the
  great Bacchanalian conspiracy of that year. For the next 17 years he was
  a leading senator and much engaged in diplomacy in the East. In
  169 he was again consul and commanded against Perseus in the early part
  of the war. &mdash; <b>cum ... legem Voconiam ... suasissem</b>: 'after I
  had spoken publicly in favor of the law o£ Voconius'. For
  <i>suasissem</i> cf. <a href="#Sect_10">10</a> <i>suasor</i> with <a
  href="#Snot_10">n.</a> The <i>Lex Voconia de mulierum hereditatibus</i>
  aimed at securing the continuance of property in families. By its
  provisions no man who possessed property valued in the censors' lists at
  100,000 sesterces or more, could appoint a woman or women as his
  <i>heres</i> or <i>heredes</i>; further, no person or persons, male or
  female, could receive under the will legacies amounting in all to a
  larger sum than that received by the principal heir or heirs. Every Roman
  will named a <i>heres</i> or <i>heredes</i>, on whom devolved all the
  privileges and duties of the deceased, with such duties as were enjoined
  by the will; particularly the duty of paying the legacies left to those
  who were not <i>heredes</i>. See Maine, Ancient Law, Ch. 6; also Hunter,
  Introd. to Roman Law, Ch. 5. &mdash; <b>magna</b>: in Latin the word
  <i>magnus</i> is the only equivalent of our 'loud'. &mdash;
  <b>lateribus</b>: 'lungs'. Cic. and the best writers rarely use
  <i>pulmones</i> for 'lungs'; the few passages in which it occurs either
  refer to victims sacrificed at the altar, or are medical or physiological
  descriptions. 'Good lungs' is always '<i>bona latera</i>' never
  <i>pulmones</i>. &mdash; <b>duo ... senectutem</b>: Ennius is said to
  have kept a school in his later days, and to have lived in a cottage with
  one servant only.</p>

  <p><b><a name="Snot_15"></a><a href="#Sect_15">15.</a> etenim</b>: this
  word generally introduces either an explanation or a proof of a preceding
  statement. Here the words are elliptic, and the real connection with what
  precedes can only be made clear by a paraphrase. 'Ennius seemed to
  delight in old age. And no wonder, since there are four causes which make
  men think old age wretched, and no one of these will bear examination'.
  <i>Etenim</i> may generally be translated 'indeed', or 'in fact'. &mdash;
  <b>cum complector animo</b>: 'when I grasp them in my thoughts'. The
  object of <i>complector</i> is to be supplied from <i>causas</i>. &mdash;
  <b>avocet</b>: <i>sc. senes</i>. The subjunctives denote that these are
  the thoughts not of the speaker, but of the persons who do think old age
  a wretched thing. See <a href="#Snot_3">n. on 3</a> <i>ferat</i>; but cf.
  Kennedy, Grammar, pref., p. 30. &mdash; <b>alteram ... tertiam</b>: in
  enumerations of more than two things <i>unus and alter</i> generally take
  the place of <i>primus</i>, and <i>secundus</i>: in Cic. these latter
  rarely occur under such circumstances. Cf. Att. 3, 15, 1; Fin. 5, 9; Off.
  1, 152; Cluent. 178. &mdash; <b>infirmius</b>: <i>sc. auam antea
  erat</i>. &mdash; <b>quam sit iusta</b>: Cicero generally
  separates from the words they qualify <i>quam</i>, <i>tam</i>,
  <i>ita</i>, <i>tantus</i>, <i>quantus</i>, often, as here, by one small
  word. Cf. below, <a href="#Sect_35">35</a> <i>quam fuit imbecillus</i>;
  40 <i>tam esse inimicum</i>. &mdash; <b>quibus</b>: the preposition
  <i>a</i> is often omitted; cf. in Pis. 91 <i>Arsinoen ... Naupactum
  fateris ab hostibus esse captas. Quibus hostibus? Nempe eis</i> etc.;
  Tusc. 3, 37 <i>sed traducis cogitationes meas ad voluptates. Quas?</i>
  Even when relative and antecedent are in the same sentence the
  preposition is not often repeated; <i>e.g.</i> Fin. 5, 68 <i>eodem in
  genere quo illa</i>. &mdash; <b>an eis</b>: <i>an</i> always introduces a
  question which is not independent, but follows upon a previous question
  either expressed or implied. Here <i>quibus</i> implies <i>omnibusne</i>.
  Cf. div. in Caec. 52 <i>quid enim dices? An id quod dictitas</i> ...
  where <i>quid</i> implies <i>nihilne</i>: also below, <a
  href="#Sect_23">23</a>, <a href="#Sect_29">29</a> <i>anne</i>. A 211,
  <i>b</i>; G. 459; H. 353, 2, n. 4. &mdash; <b>iuventute et viribus</b>:
  commonly explained as a hendiadys, <i>i.e.</i> as put for <i>iuventutis
  viribus</i>; but Cic. no more meant this than we mean 'the strength of
  youth' when we speak of 'youth and strength'. Real instances of hendiadys
  are much rarer than is generally supposed. &mdash; <b>quae</b>: =
  <i>tales ut</i>. &mdash; <b>L. Paulus</b>: this is L. Aemilius Paulus
  Macedonicus, consul in 182 B.C., and again in 168 when he finished the
  third Macedonian war by utterly defeating Perseus at Pydna. For his
  connection with Scipio and Cato see <a href="#Page_xxi">Introd</a>. &mdash; <b>pater tuus</b>:
  <i>i.e. Scipio</i>; so in <a href="#Sect_29">29</a> <i>avi tui</i>, and
  in <a href="#Sect_75">75</a> <i>avum tuum</i>, without mention of young
  Scipio's name, but in <a href="#Sect_49">49</a> <i>patris tui,
  Scipio</i>; so <a href="#Sect_77">77</a>. &mdash; <b>Fabricii</b> etc.:
  for the plurals see <a href="#Snot_13">n. on 13</a>. C. Fabricius
  Luscinus, consul in 282, 278, and 273 B.C., censor in 275, held the
  command against Pyrrhus. The Roman writers, Cicero especially, are never
  tired of eulogizing him as a pattern of old-fashioned Roman virtue.
  Manius Curius Dentatus, consul in 290, 275, and 274 practically, if not
  formally, ended the third Samnite war, and also commanded against
  Pyrrhus; see <a href="#Sect_55">55</a>. He was famed for his sturdy Roman
  simplicity and frugality. Tiberius Coruncanius as consul in 280 crushed
  an Etruscan insurrection. In 252 he became the first plebeian pontifex
  maximus. These three men are very frequently mentioned together by
  Cicero; cf. below, <a href="#Sect_43">43</a>, Lael. 18. &mdash; <b>nihil
  agebant</b>: observe that <i>nihil agebat</i> is put at the beginning of
  the first sentence, <i>nihil agebant</i> at the end of the second;
  chiasmus.</p>

  <p><b><a name="Snot_16"></a><a href="#Sect_16">16.</a> A. Claudi</b>:
  Appius Claudius, the head of the most strongly aristocratic family in
  Rome, was censor in 311 B.C., when he constructed the <i>via Appia</i>,
  and consul in 307 and 296. He had to be carried into the senate-house in
  order to oppose the peace with Pyrrhus. &mdash; <b>accedebat
  ut</b>: <i>accedit</i> is far oftener followed by a clause with
  <i>quod</i> and indicative than by a clause with <i>ut</i> and
  subjunctive. When the <i>quod</i> clause follows, it contains a fact
  looked at merely as a fact and nothing more, but the <i>ut</i> clause
  views the fact as consequent upon, or dependent on some other fact. Here
  the blindness is regarded as being the consequence of old age, though
  Livy 9, 29, 11 and other authors attribute it to the anger of the gods,
  because as censor Appius had taken the administration of the worship of
  Hercules away from the ancient family of the Potitii, and had placed it
  in the hands of public slaves. The mental vigor of Appius in his old age
  is mentioned by Cic. in Tusc. 5, 112.</p>

  <p><b>P. <a href="#Page_8">8</a> &mdash; cum Pyrrho</b>: note the
  position of the words between <i>pacem</i> and <i>foedus</i>, with both
  of which they go. This usage is called by the grammarians
  <i>coniunctio</i>; cf. n. on Lael. 8 <i>cum summi viri tum amicissimi</i>,
  also above, <i>quae iuventute geruntur et viribus</i>, below 18 <i>quae
  sunt gerenda praescribo et quo modo</i>. &mdash; <b>foedus</b>: this seems
  opposed to <i>pacem</i> as a formal engagement is to a mere abstention
  from hostilities. &mdash; <b>non dubitavit dicere</b>: when
  <i>dubitare</i> means 'to hesitate' (about a course of action), and the
  sentence is <i>negative</i>, or an interrogative sentence assuming a
  negative answer, the infinitive construction generally follows, as here;
  but the infinitive is rare in a <i>positive</i> sentence. When
  <i>dubitare</i> means to 'be in doubt' (as to whether certain statements
  are true or not), the regular construction is either <i>quin</i> with
  subj. or some form of indirect interrogative clause. Cf. below, 25. &mdash;
  <b>quo vobis</b>: from the <i>Annales</i>. In <i>mentis dementis</i> we
  have <i>oxymoron</i> (an intentional contradiction in terms) as in <a
  href="#Sect_38">38</a> <i>sensum sine sensu</i>; <a
  href="#Sect_39">39</a> <i>munus ... aufert</i>. On the case of
  <i>vobis</i>, see Roby, 1154, A. 235, <i>a</i>, H. 384, 4, n. 2. &mdash;
  <b>antehac</b>: always a dissyllable in verse, and probably so pronounced
  in prose. &mdash; <b>viai</b>: the old genitive. A. 36 <i>a</i>, G. 27,
  Rem. 1, H. 49, 2. The reading is not quite certain, if <i>viai</i> be read
  it is not altogether certain whether it depends on <i>quo</i> or on
  <i>sese flexere</i>. In the former construction we have a partitive gen
  with an adv; A. 216, <i>a</i>, 4, G. 371, Rem. 4, H. 397, 4, in the
  latter, a distinct Graecism like <i>desine querellarum</i> (Hor Od 2, 9,
  17) and the like; A. 243 Rem., G. 373 Rem. 6, H. 410 V 4. &mdash; <b>et
  tamen</b>: the sense is incompletely expressed, in full it is 'and yet
  there is no need for me to refer to Appius' speech as given by Ennius,
  since the speech itself is in existence.' Exactly similar ellipses are
  found with <i>et tamen</i> in Fin. 1, 11 and 15; 2, §§ 15, 21, 64 and 85,
  Att. 7, 3, 10, Lucretius 5, 1177. In Munro's note on the last passage a
  collection of examples will be found. &mdash; <b>Appi ... oratio</b>: the
  speech was known to Cicero, and was one of the oldest monuments of prose
  composition in Latin extant in his time, see Brut. 61. Plutarch, Pyrrhus
  19, gives an account of Appius' speech, which may founded on the
  original, he mentions it also in his tract commonly called '<i>an seni
  sit gerenda res publica</i>', c. 21. Ihne (History of Rome, Vol I. p. 521,
  Eng. ed.) doubts whether the speech, as Cic. knew it, was committed to
  writing by Appius himself. &mdash; <b>haec ille egit</b>: 'he made this
  speech.' &mdash; <b>septemdecim annis</b>: as the second (<i>alterum</i>)
  consulship was in 296, and the speech in 280, both these years are
  included in the reckoning by a usage very common in Latin. For the
  ablative cf. <a href="#Sect_19">19</a>. &mdash; <b>censor ... ante
  consulatum</b>: this was unusual, and therefore to Claudius' honor. &mdash;
  <b>grandem sane</b>: 'undoubtedly old'. &mdash; <b>et tamen sic</b>:
  <i>i.e. eum tum grandem fuisse</i> Lahmeyer wrongly says that <i>sic</i>
  points to the words <i>atque haec ille egit</i>. It may be noted that
  <i>sic</i> takes the place of an object after <i>accipimus</i>, cf. <a
  href="#Sect_77">77</a> <i>ita crederem</i>; <a href="#Sect_78">78</a>
  <i>sic mihi persuasi</i>, also <a href="#Sect_18">18</a> <i>male
  cogitanti</i>.</p>

  <p><b><a name="Snot_17"></a><a href="#Sect_17">17.</a> nihil
  afferunt</b>: 'they bring forward nothing', <i>i.e.</i> what they bring
  forward is worthless, so in Greek
  <span lang="el" title="ouden legein">&#x3BF;&#x3C5;&#x3B4;&#x3B5;&#x3BD;
  &#x3BB;&#x3B5;&#x3B3;&#x3B5;&#x3B9;&#x3BD;</span>, the opposite of which is
  <span lang="el" title="legein ti">&#x3BB;&#x3B5;&#x3B3;&#x3B5;&#x3B9;&#x3BD; &#x3C4;&#x3B9;</span>. &mdash; <b>similes ut
  si</b>: a very rare construction. Equally unusual is <i>similes tamquam
  si</i> in Div. 2, 131. In Tusc. 4, 41 and Off. 1, 87 we find <i>similiter
  ut si</i> in Fin 2, 21 and 4, 31 <i>similiter</i> or <i>similis et
  si</i>, in N.D. 3, 8 <i>similiter ac si</i>, also in Liv. 5, 5, 12
  <i>dissimilia ac si</i>, in 35, 42, 10 <i>idem ac si</i>. As regards the
  <i>ut</i> after <i>similes</i>, we may compare a few passages in which
  <i>simul ut</i> appears for <i>simul ac</i>, see Reid's n. on Academ. 2,
  51. In the English Bible there are expressions like <i>similes sunt ut si
  qui dicant</i>, 'they are like as if some men should say.' &mdash;
  <b>scandant</b>: '<i>cum</i> is used with the subjunctive when it
  expresses a kind of comparison, and especially a contrast, between the
  contents of a leading proposition and a subordinate ("whereas", etc.)'
  Madvig, 358, Obs. 3. The underlying idea in this use is generally cause,
  sometimes concession. &mdash; <b>per foros</b>: 'over the deck.' &mdash;
  <b>ille</b>: for the omission of <i>sed</i> or <i>autem</i> (<i>asyndeton
  adversativum</i>) see <a href="#Snot_3">n. on 3</a> <i>librum</i>, etc.
  &mdash; <b>clavum</b>: 'tiller'. With this passage Lahmeyer well compares
  what Cicero says of himself in Fam. 9, 15, 3 <i>sedebamus in puppi et
  clavum tenebamus; nunc autem vix est in sentina locus</i>. &mdash;
  <b>velocitate</b>: <i>velocitas</i> and <i>celeritas</i> differ very
  slightly; the former means rather speed of movement in one line the
  latter rather power of rapid motion with frequent change of direction.
  The emphatic word in this clause is <i>corporum</i>.  Cf. Off. 1, 79
  <i>honestum ... animi efficitur non corporis viribus</i>. &mdash;
  <b>consilio ... sententia</b>: <i>consilio</i>, advice;
  <i>auctoritate</i>, weight of influence; <i>sententia,</i> an opinion or
  vote formally given. &mdash; <b>quibus</b>: in twofold relation; with
  <i>orbari</i>, abl. of separation, with <i>augeri</i> of
  specification.</p>

  <p><b><a name="Snot_18"></a><a href="#Sect_18">18.</a> nisi forte</b>:
  ironical, used to introduce a possible, but absurd objection to something
  which has gone before. The verb that follows is always in the indicative.
  &mdash; <b>miles</b> etc.: 'as common soldier'; see <a href="#Snot_10">n.
  on 10</a>. &mdash; <b>in vario genere</b>: we use the plural, 'in
  different kinds'. Cf. Acad. 2, 3 <i>in omni genere belli</i>; Deiot. 12
  <i>in omni genere bellorum</i>. &mdash; <b>cessare</b>: cf. <a
  href="#Snot_13">n. on 13</a>. &mdash; <b>at senatui</b> etc.: exactly the
  same ideas are expressed, with the same mention of Cato's activity in
  Off. 1, 79. &mdash; <b>male cogitanti</b>: 'which has now for a long time
  been plotting mischief'; A. 290, <i>a</i>; G. 671, 221; H. 549, 4; 467,
  III. 2. Cf. pro Sulla 70 <i>nefarie cogitare</i>; for the use of the
  adverb see <a href="#Snot_16">n. on 16</a> <i>sic</i>. On Cato's attitude
  toward Carthage see <a href="#Page_xix">Introd</a>. &mdash; <b>vereri</b>: the construction is
  unusual. <i>Vereor</i> regularly takes after it an accusative, or else a
  clause with <i>ne</i> or <i>ut</i>. A passage much resembling this is
  Rab. Post. 10 <i>omnes qui aliquid de se verebantur</i>; cf. also Att.
  10, 4, 6 <i>de vita sua metuere</i>; Verg. Aen. 9, 207 <i>de te nil tale
  verebar</i>; in all these examples the ablative with <i>de</i> denotes
  the quarter threatened, not, as here, the quarter from which the threat
  comes. &mdash; <b>exscisam</b>: from <i>exscindo</i>; most edd.
  <i>excisam</i>, but to raze a city is <i>urbem exscindere</i> not
  <i>excidere</i>; <i>e.g.</i> Rep. 6, 11 <i>Numantiam exscindes</i>.</p>

  <p><b><a name="Snot_19"></a><a href="#Sect_19">19.</a> quam palmam</b>
  etc.: a prophecy after the event, like that in Rep. 6, 11 <i>avi
  relliquias</i>, the finishing up of the Punic wars. For the use of
  <i>relliquias</i> cf. Verg. Aen. 11, 30 <i>Troas relliquias Danaum atque
  immitis Achilli</i>; ib. 598; ib. 3, 87. &mdash; <b>tertius</b>: so all
  our MSS. This places the elder Scipio's death in 183, which agrees with
  Livy's account in 39, 50, 10. But the year before Cato's censorship was
  185 not 183, hence some edd. read <i>quintus</i> and some <i>sextus</i>
  in place of <i>tertius</i>.</p>

  <p><b>P. <a href="#Page_9">9</a> &mdash; novem annis</b>: as Cato's
  consulship was in 195 these words also apparently disagree with
  <i>tertius</i> above. <i>Novem annis post</i> means nine <i>full</i>
  years after, <i>i.e.</i> 185 not 186; cf. <a href="#Sect_42">42</a>
  <i>septem annis post</i>. &mdash; <b>enim</b>: implies that the answer
  'no' has been given to the question and proceeds to
  account for that answer. &mdash; <b>excursione</b>: a military term =
  'skirmishing'; Cf. Div. 2, 26 <i>prima orationis excursio</i>. &mdash;
  <b>hastis</b>: loosely used for <i>pilis</i>. The long old Roman
  <i>hasta</i>, whence the name <i>hastati</i>, had long before Cato's time
  been discarded for the <i>pilum</i> or short javelin, which was thrown at
  the enemy from a distance before the troops closed and used the sword.
  &mdash; <b>consilium</b>: the repetition of consilium in a different
  sense from that which it had in the sentence before seems to us awkward;
  but many such repetitions are found in Cicero. <i>Consilium</i>
  corresponds to both 'counsel' and 'council'; the senate was originally
  <i>regium consilium</i>, the king's body of advisers. Here translate
  <i>summum consilium</i> 'the supreme deliberative body'. &mdash;
  <b>senatum</b>: 'assembly of elders'. Cf. <a href="#Sect_56">56</a>
  <i>senatores, id est senes</i>. <i>Senatus</i> implies a lost verb
  <i>sen&#257;-re</i>, to be or grow old from the stem of which both
  <i>sen&#257;-tus</i> and <i>sen&#257;-tor</i> are derived. This stem
  again implies a lost noun or adjective <i>senus</i>, old. The word
  <i>senatus</i> was collective, like <i>comitatus</i>, a body of
  companions, <i>exercitus</i>, a trained band etc.</p>

  <p><b><a name="Snot_20"></a><a href="#Sect_20">20.</a> amplissimum</b>:
  'most honorable'. &mdash; <b>ut sunt ... senes</b>: the Spartan
  <span lang="el"
  title="gerousia">&#x3B3;&#x3B5;&#x3C1;&#x3BF;&#x3C5;&#x3C3;&#x3B9;&#x3B1;</span>, as it

  Herodotus uses the term
  <span lang="el"
  title="gerontes">&#x3B3;&#x3B5;&#x3C1;&#x3BF;&#x3BD;&#x3C4;&#x3B5;&#x3C2;</span>

  <span lang="el"
  title="gerontia">&#x3B3;&#x3B5;&#x3C1;&#x3BF;&#x3BD;&#x3C4;&#x3B9;&#x3B1;</span>. In the

  'to be a senator'. For <i>ut ... sic</i> cf. Academ. 2, 14, <i>similiter
  vos cum perturbare, ut illi rem publicam</i>, <i>sic vos philosophiam
  velitis</i>; also Lael. 19. &mdash; <b>audire</b>: like
  <span lang="el"
  title="akouô">&#x3B1;&#x3BA;&#x3BF;&#x3C5;&#x3C9;</span>, used especially of
  historical matters, since instruction in them was almost entirely oral.
  Cf. <span lang="el"
  title="anêkoos">&#x3B1;&#x3BD;&#x3B7;&#x3BA;&#x3BF;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span> = 'ignorant
  of history'. &mdash; <b>voletis</b>: see note on 7 <i>faciam ut
  potero</i>; cf. Roby, 1464, <i>a</i>; Madvig, 339, Obs. 1; A. 278,
  <i>b</i>; G. 234, Rem. 1; H. 470, 2. &mdash; <b>adulescentibus</b>: Cic.,
  when he wrote this, was possibly thinking of Athens and Alcibiades.
  &mdash; <b>labefactatas</b>: the verb <i>labefacio</i> is foreign to good
  prose, in which <i>labefacto</i> is used. &mdash; <b>sustentatas</b>:
  Cic. does not use <i>sustentus</i>. In Mur. 3 <i>sustinenda</i> is

  (or octonarius), and is scanned thus: &mdash;</p>

	<div class="center">
	<img src="images/097.png" alt="Octonarius" />

  <p>In all kinds of iambic verse the old Romans freely introduced spondees
  where the Greeks used iambi; so in hexameters spondees for dactyls. Cf.
  Hor. Ep. ad Pis. 254 <i>et seq.</i> &mdash; <b>cedo</b>: = <i>dic</i>;
  from <i>ce</i>, the enclitic particle involved in
  <i>hic = (hi-ce)</i> etc. and <i>da</i>, the root of <i>do</i>. So
  <i>cette = ce-d&#259;te = cedte</i>, then <i>cette</i> by assimilation of
  <i>d</i> to <i>t</i>. The original meaning would thus be 'give here', and
  in this sense the word is often used. See Lex. <i>Dare</i> is commonly
  put for <i>dicere</i>, as <i>accipere</i> is for <i>audire</i>. &mdash;

  lived about 264-194 B.C. His great work was a history of the First Punic
  War written in Saturnian verse, the rude indigenous metre of early Roman
  poetry. He wrote also plays,&mdash;tragedies and comedies, both
  <i>palliatae</i> and <i>praetextae</i>. For an account of him see
  Cruttwell, History of Roman Literature; also, Sellar, Roman Poets of the
  Republic, Ch. 3. If <i>Ludo</i> be read, it may be either from the Latin
  <i>ludus</i> (Naevius entitled a comedy <i>Ludius</i>) or from
  <span
  lang="el" title="Lydos">&#x39B;&#x3C5;&#x3B4;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span>, Lydian. &mdash;
  <b>poetae</b>: Naevius seems to have been in the habit of adding
  <i>poeta</i> to his name. It appears in the well-known epitaph said to
  have been written by himself, also in the lines written against him by
  the family poet of the Metelli: '<i>malum dabunt Metelli Naevio
  poetae</i>'. The name <i>poeta</i> was new in Naevius' time and was just
  displacing the old Latin name <i>vates</i>; see Munro on Lucr. 1, 102.
  &mdash; <b>proveniebant</b> etc.: the same metre as above, divided thus
  by Lahmeyer: &mdash;</p>

  <i>provenire</i> in the sense of 'to grow up', comparing Plin. Ep. 1, 13,
  1 <i>magnum proventum</i> ('crop') <i>poetarum annus hic attulit</i>;
  Sall. Cat. 8, 3 <i>provenere ibi scriptorum magna ingenia</i>. &mdash;

  Academ. 2, 97 <i>Epicurus quem isti tardum putant</i>. &mdash;
  <b>Themistocles</b>: famed for his memory. &mdash; <b>civium</b>:
  'fellow-countrymen'; <i>perceperat</i>: 'had grasped' or 'mastered'.
  &mdash; <b>qui ... solitum</b>: 'that he often addressed as Lysimachus
  some one who for all that was Aristides'. The direct object of
  <i>salutare</i> is omitted. For <i>qui = tametsi is</i> cf. Att. 1,
  13, 3 <i>nosmet ipsi, qui Lycurgei fuissemus, cotidie demitigamur</i>;

  <i>fuit = vixit</i>; <a href="#Sect_56">56</a>, <a

  <i>Originum</i>. &mdash; <b>in memoriam redeo mortuorum</b>: the genitive

  <i>redite in memoriam, iudices, quae libido istius fuerit</i>; also
  below, 59 <i>in gratiam redire cum voluptate</i>. Here translate 'I
  refresh my memory of the dead'. &mdash; <b>quemquam senem</b>: the best
  writers do not use <i>quisquam </i>as an adjective, but there is no need
  to alter <i>senem</i> into <i>senum</i> as some editors do, since
  <i>senem</i> is a substitute for a clause <i>cum senex esset</i>; 'I
  never heard that anybody because he was an old man ...'. <i>Senes</i>
  must be so taken in <a href="#Sect_22">22</a>, since <i>pontifices</i>
  etc. cannot stand as adjectives. Cf. <a href="#Snot_10">n. on 10</a>
  <i>adulescentulus miles</i>. &mdash; <b>vadimonia</b>: 'their
  appointments to appear in court, the debts due to them and the debts they
  owe'. When the hearing of a suit had to be adjourned, the defendant was
  bound over either on his own recognizance merely (<i>pure</i>) or along
  with sureties (<i>vades</i>) to appear in court on the day appointed for
  the next hearing, a sum or sums of money being forfeited in case of his
  non-appearance. The engagement to appear was technically called
  <i>vadimonium</i>; when the defendant entered into the engagement he was
  said <i>vadimonium promittere</i>; if he kept the engagement, <i>v.
  obire</i> or <i>sistere</i>; if he failed in it, <i>v. deserere</i>. The
  plural <i>vadimonia</i> is here used because a number of suits is meant;
  the word <i>constituta</i> is chosen as a more general term than
  <i>promissa</i>, and as referring to the circumstances of both plaintiff
  and defendant. Strictly speaking, it is the presiding judge who
  <i>vadimonia constituit</i>. On this account <i>vadimonia constituta</i>
  should be translated as above 'appointments', and not <i>'bonds'</i> or
  <i>'engagements</i>' to appear in court.</p>

  translate 'statesmen'. &mdash; <b>in vita ... quieta</b>: 'in an
  unofficial and retired life'. There is chiasmus here, since
  <i>privata</i> is contrasted with <i>honoratis</i> and <i>quieta</i> with
  <i>claris</i>. &mdash; <b>summam senectutem</b>: Sophocles died at the
  age of 90 in 405 B.C. &mdash; <b>quod propter studium</b>: 'from his
  devotion to this occupation'. &mdash; <b>filiis</b>: except Plutarch, who
  probably follows Cicero's words, all the authorities tell the story of
  the poet's eldest son Iophon only. The tale is full of improbabilities.
  &mdash; <b>rem</b>: = <i>rem familiarem</i> as in <a

  'fathers are often prevented from managing their property'. For the
  construction cf. the expression <i>interdicere alicui aqua et igni:
  interdici</i> is here used impersonally with <i>patribus</i> in the dat.;
  A. 230; H. 384, 5; <i>bonis</i> is abl. of separation (deprivation). The
  fragment of the XII tables here referred to is thus given in Dirksen's
  edition: <i>sei fouriosos aut prodicos (prodigus) escit (erit) adenatorum
  centiliomque (gentiliumque) eius potestas estod, i.e.</i> the agnates
  (male relatives whose kinship with the <i>furiosus</i> is derived through
  males) and members of his <i>gens</i> are to administer his property. We

  <b>Isocraten Gorgian</b>: <a href="#Snot_13">nn. on 13</a>. &mdash;
  <b>philosophorum principes</b>: 'in the first rank of

  nor that of his death can be determined; he 'flourished' about 530. He
  lived mostly in the Greek settlements of lower Italy, where his school
  existed for some centuries after his death. &mdash; <b>Democritum</b>: of
  Abdera, one of the originators of the theory of atoms; said to have lived
  from 460 to 361 or 357 B.C. &mdash; <b>Xenocraten</b>: after Plato,
  Speusippus was the first head of the Academic School; Xenocrates
  succeeded him. He lived from 397 to 315 or 313. &mdash; <b>Zenonem</b>:
  of Citium in Cyprus, founder of Stoicism, born about 357, is said to have
  lived to the age of 98. &mdash; <b>Cleanthen</b>: he followed Zeno in the
  presidency of the Stoic school. His age at death is variously given as 99
  and as 80 years. &mdash; <b>quem vidistis</b>: see <a href="#Page_xxi">Introd</a>. It is rather
  curious that Cic. should make Cato speak with admiration of Diogenes, to
  whom he had shown great hostility. &mdash; <b>Diogenen</b>: Cic. probably
  wrote in <i>-an, -en,</i> not in <i>-am, -em</i> the accusatives of Greek
  proper names in <i>-as, -es</i>. &mdash; <b>Stoicum</b>: to distinguish
  him from Diogenes the Cynic. &mdash; <b>agitatio</b>: Cic. uses
  <i>agitatio</i> and <i>actio</i> almost interchangeably; cf. <i>agitatio
  rerum</i> in De Or. 3, 88 with <i>actio rerum</i> in Acad. 2, 62 and
  elsewhere. <i>Actus</i> in this sense occurs only in silver Latin.</p>

  <p><b><a name="Snot_24"></a><a href="#Sect_24">24.</a> age</b>: a common
  form of transition to a new subject; brief for <i>'hoc age'</i>, 'do
  this', <i>i.e.</i> 'attend to this that I am going to say'. The common
  use of <span lang="el" title="age">&#x3B1;&#x3B3;&#x3B5;</span> in Greek is exactly similar.
  &mdash; <b>ut ... omittamus</b>: Cf. <a href="#Snot_52">n. on 52</a>
  <i>ut</i>. &mdash; <b>possum nominare</b>: 'I am able to name'; in
  colloquial English 'I <i>might</i> name'. The Latins occasionally use
  also a hypothetical form, where <i>possim</i> or <i>possem</i> stands in
  the apodosis of a conditional sentence, the protasis of which is not
  expressed; but the missing protasis is generally easily supplied and was
  distinctly present to the writer's mind. <i>E.g.</i> in Tusc. 1, 88 we
  have <i>dici hoc in te non potest; posset in Tarquinio; at in mortuo ne
  intellegi quidem (potest)</i>, where the reason for the change from
  <i>potest</i> to <i>posset</i> is quite evident. In translating from
  English into Latin it is far safer to use the indicative. Cf. <a
  href="#Sect_55">55</a> <i>possum persequi</i>. A. 311, <i>c</i>; G. 599,
  Rem. 3; H. 511, 1, n. 3, 476, 4. &mdash; <b>ex agro ... Romanos</b>:
  'country-bred Romans (<i>i.e.</i> Roman citizens) belonging to the Sabine
  district'. The words <i>ex agro Sabino</i> form an attributive phrase
  qualifying <i>Romanos</i> just as <i>rusticos</i> does. &mdash;
  <b>numquam fere</b>: 'scarcely ever'. &mdash; <b>maiora opera</b>: 'farm
  work of any importance'. This use of <i>opera</i> is common in Vergil's
  Georgics. &mdash; <b>non</b>: the repetition of the negative after
  <i>numquam</i> is common in Latin; in English <i>never ... not</i> is
  found in dialects only. Cf. Lael. 48 <i>non tantum ... non plus quam</i>.

  <a href="#Snot_3">n. on 3</a> <i>ceteris</i>. Notice the proleptic use.

  commonly found in our texts. For the use here cf. <a href="#Snot_4">n. on
  4</a> <i>eandem</i>. &mdash; <b>pertinere</b>: present for future.
  &mdash; <b>sent ... prosint</b>: the line is given as Ribbeck prints it.
  He scans it as a '<i>bacchius</i>', consisting of four feet, with the
  measurement <img src="images/102.png" alt="meter" width="40" height="10" />,
  the last syllable of <i>saeclo</i> seeming to be
  shortened. Cicero quotes the same line in Tusc. 1, 31 adding <i>ut ait
  (Statius) in Synephebis, quid spectans nisi etiam postera saecla ad se
  pertinere? Saeclo</i> = 'generation'. For mood of <i>prosint</i> see A
  317; G. 632, H. 497, I. &mdash; <b>Statius noster</b>: 'our
  fellow-countryman Statius'. So Arch. 22 <i>Ennius noster</i>. Caecilius
  Statius, born among the Insubres, wrote Latin comedies which were largely
  borrowed from the Greek of Menander. The original of the <i>Synephebi</i>

  which many recent editors still keep, are probably incorrect, at all
  events it is certain that the nominative and ablative plural of deus
  formed monosyllables, except occasionally in poetry, where <i>dei</i>,
  <i>deis</i> were used. Even these <i>dissyllabic</i> forms scarcely occur
  before Ovid. &mdash; <b>et</b>: emphatic at the beginning of a sentence:
  'aye, and'. &mdash; <b>melius</b>: <i>sc. dixit</i>. &mdash;
  <b>illud</b>: 'the following' A. 102, b, G. 292, 4; H. 450, 3. &mdash;
  <b>idem</b>: <i>&#299;dem</i>, not <i>&#301;dem</i>. &mdash;
  <b>edepol</b>: literally, 'ah, god Pollux', <i>e</i> being an
  interjection, <i>de</i> a shortened form of the vocative of <i>deus,
  pol</i> abbreviated from <i>Pollux</i>. The asseveration is mostly
  confined to comedy. The lines come from a play by Statius called Plocium

  &mdash; <b>tum equidem</b> etc.: these lines, as well as those above,
  occurred in a play of Statius called <i>'Ephesio'</i> see Ribbeck's
  'Fragmenta'. &mdash; <b>senecta</b>: not used by prose writers before the
  time of silver Latin. &mdash; <b>deputo</b>: this compound is used by the
  dramatists and then does not occur again till late Latin times. &mdash;
  <b>eumpse</b>: like <i>ipse</i> and <i>reapse</i> (for which see n. on
  Lael. 47) this word contains the enclitic particle <i>pe</i> (probably
  another form of <i>que</i>), found in <i>nem pe</i>, <i>quis-p-iam</i>
  etc., along with <i>se</i>, which belongs to an old demonstrative pronoun
  once declined <i>sos</i>, <i>sa</i>, <i>sum</i>, the masc. and fem. of

  title="hê">&#x201B;&#x3B7;</span>. The form was no doubt
  originally <i>eumpsum</i>, like <i>ipsom</i> (<i>ipsum</i>), but has
  passed into its present form just as <i>ipsos</i> (nom.) became
  <i>ipso</i>, then <i>ipse</i>. The only difference in sense between
  <i>eumpse</i> and the simple <i>eum</i> is that the former is more
  emphatic. The pronoun <i>eumpse</i> is the subject of the infinitive
  <i>sentire</i>, but the substantive, <i>senex</i>, to which the pronoun
  refers, is not expressed. &mdash; <b>odiosum</b>: cf. <a href="#Snot_4">n.
  on 4</a>.</p>

  <p><b><a name="Snot_26"></a><a href="#Sect_26">26.</a> iucundum ...
  odiosum</b>: elliptic, = <i>'iucundum' potius quam 'odiosum' senem esse
  dicendum est</i>. &mdash; <b>ut ... delectantur</b>: cf. Lael. 101; also
  below, <a href="#Sect_29">29</a>. &mdash; <b>sapientes senes</b>: neither
  of these words is used as an adjective here; the whole expression =
  <i>sapientes, cum facti sunt senes</i>. &mdash; <b>levior</b>: cf. the
  fragm. of Callimachus:

  &#x3C6;&#x3B9;&#x3BB;&#x3B5;&#x3BF;&#x3C5;&#x3C3;&#x3B9;</span>. &mdash;
  <b>coluntur et diliguntur</b>: <i>colere</i> rather implies the external
  marks of respect (cf. <i>coli</i> in <a href="#Sect_7">7</a>),
  <i>diligere</i> the inner feeling of affection. &mdash; <b>praeceptis</b>
  etc.: cf. Off. 1, 122 <i>ineuntis enim aetatis inscitia senum
  constituenda et regenda prudentia est</i>. &mdash; <b>me ...
  iucundos</b>: put for <i>me iucundum esse quam vos mihi estis
  iucundi</i>. The attraction of a finite verb into the infinitive after
  <i>quam</i> is not uncommon; cf. <a href="#Snot_1">n. on 1</a> <i>quibus
  me ipsum</i> (Roby, 1784, <i>b</i>; A. 336, <i>b</i>, Rem.; H. 524, 1, 2).
  <i>Minus</i>, be it observed, does not qualify <i>intellego</i>, but
  <i>iucundos</i>. &mdash; <b>sed</b>: here <i>analeptic</i>, <i>i.e.</i>
  it introduces a return to the subject proper after a digression, so in <a
  href="#Sect_31">31</a>. &mdash; <b>videtis, ut ... sit</b>: here <i>ut =
  quo modo</i>; 'how'. &mdash; <b>senectus ... cuiusque</b>: the abstract
  <i>senectus</i> is put for <i>senes</i> as in <a href="#Sect_34">34</a>;
  hence <i>cuiusque, sc. senis</i>. So above <i>adulescentia</i>
  = <i>adulescentes</i>. &mdash; <b>agens aliquid</b>: this phrase differs
  from <i>agat</i> in that while the subjunctive would express the
  <i>fact</i> of action, the participial phrase expresses rather the
  constant <i>tendency</i> to act. <i>Agens aliquid</i> forms a sort of
  attribute to <i>senectus</i>, parallel with <i>operosa. Moliri</i>
  differs from <i>agere</i> in that it implies the bringing into existence
  of some object. Cf. Off. 3, 102 <i>agere aliquid et moliri volunt</i>;
  Acad. 2, 22 <i>ut moliatur aliquid et faciat</i>; N.D. 1, 2 <i>utrum di
  nihil agant, nihil moliantur</i>; Mur. 82 <i>et agant et moliantur</i>.

  = learn on and on, go on learning. &mdash; <b>ut ... videmus</b>: put, as
  Allen observes, for <i>ut Solon fecit, quem videmus</i>. &mdash;
  <b>Solonem</b>: see also 50. The line (<i>versibus</i> here is an
  exaggeration; in 50 it is <i>versiculus</i>) is preserved by Plato in his
  Timaeus and by Plutarch, Sol. 31

  The age of Solon at his death is variously given as 80 or 100 years.
  &mdash; <b>videmus</b>: the Latins frequently use 'we see' for 'we read'.
  See n. on Lael. 39, also below, <a href="#Sect_69">69</a> <i>ut scriptum
  video</i>. &mdash; <b>gloriantem</b>: A. 292, <i>e</i>; G. 536, 527, Rem.
  1; H. 535, I. 4. Notice the change to the infinitive in <i>uti</i> below.
  &mdash; <b>senex</b>: <i>i.e. cum senex essem</i>; so <a
  href="#Sect_27">27</a> <i>adulescens desiderabam</i>; <a
  href="#Sect_30">30</a> <i>memini puer</i>. Plutarch (Cato 2) gives an
  account of Cato's study of Greek in his old age. &mdash; <b>sic</b>: this
  word does not qualify <i>avide</i>, but refers on to <i>quasi</i>, so
  that <i>sic ... quasi cupiens</i> = 'thus, <i>viz.</i> like one
  desiring'. Cf. <a href="#Snot_12">n. on 12</a> <i>ita cupide fruebar
  quasi</i>; also <a href="#Sect_35">35</a> <i>tamquam ... sic</i>.
  <i>Quasi</i> serves to soften the metaphor in <i>sitim</i>; cf. n. on
  Lael. 3. &mdash; <b>cupiens</b>: after <i>quasi</i> a finite verb
  <i>(cuperem)</i> would have been more usual, as in <a
  href="#Sect_12">12</a> <i>ita ... quasi divinarem</i>. Cf. however <a
  href="#Sect_22">22</a> <i>quasi desipientem</i>. &mdash; <b>ea ipsa
  mihi</b>: for the juxtaposition of pronouns, which is rather sought after
  in Latin, cf. <a href="#Sect_72">72</a> <i>ipsa suum eadem quae</i>.
  &mdash; <b>exemplis</b>: = <i>pro exemplis</i>, or <i>exemplorum loco</i>
  (cf. <a href="#Snot_21">n. on 21</a> <i>Lysimachum</i>), so that those
  editors are wrong who say that we have here an example of the antecedent
  thrust into the relative clause, as though <i>ea ipsa quibus exemplis</i>
  were put for <i>ea ipsa exempla quibus</i>. &mdash; <b>quod</b>: = <i>ut
  cum iam senex esset disceret</i>. &mdash; <b>Socraten</b>: Cic. probably
  learned this fact from Plato's Menexenus 235 E and Euthydemus 272 C where
  Connus is named as the teacher of Socrates in music. In the Euthydemus
  Socrates says that the boys attending Connus' lessons laughed at him and
  called Connus

  Cf. also Fam. 9, 22, 3 <i>Socraten fidibus docuit nobilissimus fidicen;
  is Connus vocitatus est</i>; Val. Max. 8, 7, 8.
  &mdash; <b>in fidibus</b>: 'in the case of the lyre'. Tücking quotes
  Quintilian 9, 2, 5 <i>quod in fidibus fieri vidimus</i>. The Greek word
  <i>cithara</i> is not used by Cicero and does not become common in Latin
  prose till long after Cicero's time, though he several times uses the
  words <i>citharoedus, citharista</i>, when referring to Greek
  professional players. The word <i>lyra</i> too is rare in early prose; it
  occurs in Tusc. 1, 4 in connection with a Greek, where in the same
  sentence <i>fides</i> is used as an equivalent. &mdash; <b>audirem</b>:
  for <i>audire = legendo cognoscere</i> see <a href="#Snot_20">n. on
  20</a>. &mdash; <b>vellem</b>: <i>sc. si possem</i>. &mdash; <b>discebant
  ... antiqui</b>: doubts have been felt as to the genuineness of the
  clause. In Tusc. 4, 3 a passage of Cato is quoted which refers to the use
  of the <i>tibia</i> among the ancient Romans; immediately afterwards the
  antiquity of practice on the <i>fides</i> at Rome is mentioned, though
  not expressly on Cato's authority. The words cannot be said to be
  unsuited either to the person or to the occasion. &mdash; <b>discebant
  ... fidibus</b>: the verb <i>canere</i>, which means 'to play' as well as
  'to sing', must be supplied; <i>fidibus</i> is then an ablative of the
  means or instrument. There is the same ellipsis of <i>canere</i> in the
  phrases <i>docere fidibus</i> (Fam. 9, 22, 3) and <i>scire fidibus</i>
  (Terence, Eunuchus 133). Cf. Roby, 1217.</p>

  <p><b>P. <a href="#Page_12">12</a> &mdash; <a name="Snot_27"></a><a
  href="#Sect_27">27.</a> ne ... quidem</b>: these two words together
  correspond to the Greek <span lang="el"
  title="oude">&#x3BF;&#x3C5;&#x3B4;&#x3B5;</span> (<span lang="el"
  title="ou">&#x3BF;&#x3C5;</span> = ne, <span lang="el"
  title="de">&#x3B4;&#x3B5;</span> = quidem), and
  are best translated here by 'nor' rather than by 'not even'. The
  rendering 'not even', though required by some passages, will often
  misrepresent the Latin. &mdash; <b>locus</b>: <i>locus</i> (like
  <span lang="el"
  title="topos">&#x3C4;&#x3BF;&#x3C0;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span> in Greek) is a rhetorical term
  with a technical meaning. The pleader is to anticipate the arguments he
  may find it necessary to use in different cases, and is to arrange them
  under certain heads; each head is called a
  <span
  lang="el" title="topos">&#x3C4;&#x3BF;&#x3C0;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span> or <i>locus</i>, meaning
  literally the <i>place</i> where a pleader is to look for an argument
  when wanted. Hence <i>locus</i> came to mean 'a cut-and-dried argument'
  or, as here, a 'commonplace'. It is often found in Cicero's rhetorical
  writings. &mdash; <b>non plus quam</b>: 'any more than'. After the
  negative <i>ne</i> above it is incorrect to translate <i>non</i> by a
  negative in English, though the repetition of the negative is common
  enough in Latin, as in some English dialects. Cf. <a href="#Snot_24">n.
  on 24</a>. <i>Plus</i> here = <i>magis</i>. &mdash; <b>quod est</b>:
  <i>sc. tibi</i>, 'what you have', so Paradoxa 18 and 52 <i>satis esse,
  quod est</i>. &mdash; <b>agas</b>: <i>quisquis</i> is generally
  accompanied by the indicative, as in Verg. Aen. 2, 49 <i>quidquid id
  est</i> etc.; see Roby, 1697; A. 309, <i>c</i>; G. 246, 4; H. 476, 3. The
  subjunctive is here used, with the imaginary second person, to render
  prominent the hypothetical and indefinite character of the verb
  statement. Roby, 1544-1546; Madvig, 370, 494, Obs. 5, (6). &mdash;
  <b>vox</b>: 'utterance'; the word is used only of speeches in some way
  specially remarkable. &mdash; <b>contemptior</b>: 'more despicable'. The
  passive participle of <i>contemno</i> has the sense of an adjective in
  -<i>bilis</i>, like <i>invictus</i> and many others. &mdash;
  <b>Milonis</b>: the most famous of the Greek athletes. He lived at the
  end of the sixth century B.C., and the praises of his victories were sung
  by Simonides. It was under his leadership that his native city Croton, in
  Magna Graecia, attacked and destroyed Sybaris. Many stories are told by
  the ancients about his feats of strength (see 33), and about his power of
  consuming food. He is said to have been a prominent disciple of
  Pythagoras. &mdash; <b>illacrimans</b>: beware of spelling <i>lacrima</i>
  with either <i>ch</i> for <i>c</i> or <i>y</i> for <i>i</i>; these
  spellings are without justification. The <i>y</i> rests on the absurd
  assumption that the Latins borrowed their word <i>lacrima</i> straight
  from the Greek <span lang="el"
  title="dakry">&#x3B4;&#x3B1;&#x3BA;&#x3C1;&#x3C5;</span>. &mdash;
  <b>dixisse</b>: combinations like <i>dicitur dixisse</i> are exceedingly
  rare in good Latin. Cicero nearly always uses two different verbs;
  <i>i.e.</i> he says <i>aiunt dicere</i> and the like. &mdash; <b>at</b>:
  there is an ellipsis here such as 'those young men's muscles are powerful
  but ...'. This elliptic use of <i>at</i> is common in sudden exclamations
  of grief, annoyance, surprise etc. &mdash; <b>vero</b>: this is common in
  emphatic replies, whether the reply convey assent, or, as here, a retort.
  The usage is well illustrated in Nägelsbach's Stilistik, § 197, 2.
  &mdash; <b>tam</b>: <i>sc. mortui sunt</i>. &mdash; <b>nugator</b>:
  <i>nugari</i> = <span lang="el"
  title="lêrein">&#x3BB;&#x3B7;&#x3C1;&#x3B5;&#x3B9;&#x3BD;</span>, 'to
  trifle'. &mdash; <b>ex te</b>: Cato here identifies a man's person with
  his soul and intellect, the body being regarded as a mere dress; cf. Rep.
  6, 26 <i>mens cuiusque is est quisque</i>. <i>Ex te</i>, literally, 'out
  of yourself', <i>i.e.</i> 'from your real self's resources'. &mdash;
  <b>lateribus</b>: see <a href="#Snot_14">n. on 14</a>. &mdash;
  <b>Aelius</b>: his <i>cognomen</i> was Paetus; he was consul in 198, and
  censor in 194 B.C. He was one of the earliest and most famous writers on
  Roman Law. His great commentary on the XII tables is often referred to by
  Cicero, who several times quotes Ennius' line about him &mdash;
  <i>egregie cordatus homo catus Aelius Sextus</i>. &mdash; <b>tale</b>:
  <i>sc. dixit</i>. &mdash; <b>Coruncanius</b>: <a href="#Snot_15">n. on
  15</a>. &mdash; <b>P. Crassus</b>: consul in 205 B.C. with the elder
  Africanus; pontifex maximus from 212 to his death in 183. He was famous
  both as a lawyer (see below, 50; also Liv. 30, 1, 5 <i>iuris pontifici
  peritissimus</i>) and as a statesman (see 61). <i>Modo</i> therefore
  covers a space of at least 33 years, so that it cannot well be translated
  by our 'lately'; say rather 'nearer our time'. The amount of time implied
  by <i>modo</i> and <i>nuper</i> depends entirely on the context; for
  <i>modo</i> see Lael. 6 with note, for <i>nuper</i> below, <a
  href="#Snot_61">n. on 61</a>, where it is used of Crassus as <i>modo</i>
  is here. &mdash; <b>praescribebantur</b>: the meaning is that these
  lawyers practised in old age as jurisconsults, <i>i.e.</i> according to
  old Roman custom, they gave audience in the early hours of the day to all
  who chose to consult them about legal difficulties. &mdash; <b>est
  provecta</b>: literally 'was carried forward', <i>i.e.</i> 'continued',
  'remained'. Some wrongly take the phrase to mean 'made progress',
  'increased', a sense which would require the imperfect,
  <i>provehebatur</i>. &mdash; <b>prudentia</b>: here, as often, 'legal
  skill'.</p>

  <p><b><a name="Snot_28"></a><a
  href="#Sect_28">28.</a> orator</b>: emphatic position. &mdash; <b>senectute</b>: causal
  ablative; not 'in age', but 'owing to age'. &mdash; <b>omnino &mdash; sed
  tamen</b>: 'no doubt &mdash; but still'. <i>Omnino</i> (literally,
  'altogether') has two almost exactly opposite uses &mdash; (1) the
  affirmative, cf. 9; (2) the concessive, which we have here and in 45. The
  circumstance which is contrasted with the admitted circumstance is
  usually introduced by <i>sed tamen</i> or <i>sed</i> as in 45, but in
  Lael. 98 by the less emphatic <i>autem</i>, while in Lael. 69 there is no
  introductory particle. &mdash; <b>canorum ... senectute</b>:
  <i>canorum</i> implies the combination of power with clearness in a
  voice. For the mixture of metaphors in <i>canorum splendescit</i> edd.
  quote Soph. Phil. 189 <span lang="el" title="achô têlephanês">&#x3B1;&#x3C7;&#x3C9;
  &#x3C4;&#x3B7;&#x3BB;&#x3B5;&#x3C6;&#x3B1;&#x3BD;&#x3B7;&#x3C2;</span>; Cic. De Or.
  2, 60 <i>illorum tactu orationem meam quasi colorari</i>. &mdash;
  <b>nescio quo pacto</b>: literally, 'I know not on what terms'; quite
  interchangeable with <i>nescio quo modo</i>; cf. 82. A. 334, <i>e</i>; G.
  469, Rem. 2; H. 529, 5, 3). &mdash; <b>adhuc non</b>: purposely put for
  <i>nondum</i>, because more emphasis is thus thrown both on the time-word
  and on the negation. The common view that <i>nondum</i> was avoided
  because it would have implied that Cato <i>expected</i> to lose the
  <i>canorum</i> is certainly wrong. &mdash; <b>et videtis</b>: 'though you
  see my years'. The adversative use of <i>et</i> for <i>autem</i> or
  <i>tamen</i> after the negative is not very uncommon in Cicero, but there
  are few examples of the usage in the speeches. Cf. Lael. 26 <i>et
  quidquid</i>; so sometimes <i>que</i> as above, 13; also Lael. 30 <i>ut
  nullo egeat suaque omnia in se posita iudicet</i>. &mdash; <b>seni</b>:
  Madvig's em. for <i>senis</i>. In Leg. 1, 11 allusion is made to the
  great change which advancing years had wrought in Cicero's own
  impassioned oratory. He was no doubt thinking of that change when he
  wrote the words we have here. &mdash; <b>sermo</b>: 'style of speaking';
  a word of wider meaning than <i>oratio</i>, which only denotes public
  speaking. &mdash; <b>quietus et remissus</b>: 'subdued and gentle'. The
  metaphor in <i>remissus</i> (which occurs also in 81) refers to the
  loosening of a tight-stretched string; cf. <i>intentum</i> etc. in <a
  href="#Sect_37">37</a> with <a href="#Snot_37">n.</a> With the
  whole passage cf. Plin. Ep. 3, 1, 2 <i>nam iuvenes confusa adhuc quaedam
  et quasi turbata non indecent; senibus placida omnia et ordinata
  conveniunt</i>. &mdash; <b>facit audientiam</b>: 'procures of itself a
  hearing for it'. In the words <i>per se ipsa</i> there is no doubt an
  allusion to the custom at large meetings in ancient times whereby the
  <i>praeco</i> or <span lang="el"
  title="kêryx">&#x3BA;&#x3B7;&#x3C1;&#x3C5;&#x3BE;</span> called on the
  people to listen to the speakers. Cf. Liv. 43, 16, 8 <i>praeconem
  audientiam facere iussit</i>. Note that this is the only classical use of
  the word <i>audientia</i>; it has not the meaning of our 'audience'
  either in the sense of a body of listeners, or as used in the expression
  'to give audience'. &mdash; <b>composita et mitis</b>: 'unimpassioned and
  smooth'. Cf. Quintil. 6, 2, 9 <i>affectus igitur hos concitatos, illos
  mitis atque compositos esse dixerunt</i>. &mdash; <b>quam ...
  nequeas</b>: 'and if you cannot practise oratory yourself'. Evidently
  <i>quam</i> refers to <i>oratio</i> in the widest sense, not to the
  special style of oratory mentioned in the last sentence. With <i>si
  nequeas</i> cf. <i>nisi exerceas</i> in <a href="#Sect_21">21</a> with <a
  href="#Snot_21">n.</a> &mdash; <b>Scipioni et Laelio</b>: '<i>a</i>
  Scipio and <i>a</i> Laelius'; <i>i.e.</i> 'young friends such as Scipio
  and Laelius are to me'. &mdash; <b>praecipere</b>: here absolute, =
  <i>praecepta dare</i>; usually an accusative follows. &mdash; <b>studiis
  iuventutis</b>: 'the zeal of youth'. <i>Studiis</i> does not imply here
  the deference of youth to age; the studia meant are the <i>virtutum
  studia</i> of <a href="#Sect_26">26</a>.</p>

  <p><b><a name="Snot_29"></a><a
  href="#Sect_29">29.</a> ne ... instruat</b>: <i>docere</i> is to impart knowledge,
  <i>instituere</i> (literally 'to ground' or 'establish') is to form the
  intellect and character by means of knowledge, <i>instruere</i>, to teach
  the pupil how he may bring his acquirements to bear in practical life.
  &mdash; <b>offici munus</b>: 'performance of duty'; cf. 35, 72; Fam. 6,
  14. In scores of passages in Cicero we find <i>officium et munus</i>,
  'duty and function', as in <a href="#Sect_34">34</a>. &mdash; <b>Cn. et
  P. Scipiones</b>: in Cic. the plural is always used where two men of the
  same family are mentioned and their names connected by et. In other
  writers the plural is regular, the singular exceptional, as in Sall. Iug.
  42, 1 <i>Ti. et C. Gracchus</i>; Liv. 6, 22 <i>Sp. et L. Papirius</i>.
  Even with other nouns the plural is regular; e.g. Cic. Phil. 2, 101
  <i>arationes Campana et Leontina</i>, though a little above we have
  <i>mense Aprili atque Maio</i>. [See Draeger, Hist. Synt. 1², p. 1.]
  Gnaeus (<i>not</i> Cnaeus &mdash; see n. on Lael. 3) Cornelius Scipio was
  consul in 222 B.C. and was sent to Spain at the outbreak of the Second
  Punic war to command against Hasdrubal. Publius was consul in 218, and
  after being defeated by Hannibal at the Ticinus, joined his brother in
  Spain. At first they won important successes, but in 212 they were
  hemmed in and killed, after a crushing defeat. &mdash; <b>L.
  Aemilius</b>: the father of Macedonicus. He was consul in 219 and
  defeated the Illyrii; but when consul again in 216 was defeated and
  killed at Cannae. See <a href="#Sect_75">75</a>. For <i>avi duo</i> cf.
  82. &mdash; <b>consenuerint ... defecerint</b>: <i>coniunctio</i>, for
  which see <a href="#Snot_16">n. on 16</a>. For the mood see A. 313,

  '<i>though</i> he was very old', the clause depends on the following
  words, not on the preceding. &mdash; <b>negat</b>: in Latin as in English
  the present tense is used in quotations from books. &mdash;
  <b>Metellum</b>: was consul in 251 B.C. and won a great victory over the
  Carthaginians at Panormus (Palermo); consul again in 247. See below, <a

  <b>puer</b>: the expression is peculiar, being abbreviated from <i>quod
  puer vidi</i> or something of the kind. Quintil. 8, 3, 31 has <i>memini
  iuvenis</i>. In Rep. 1, 23 Cicero says <i>memini me admodum

  Latin from the Greek <span lang="el" title="nai">&#x3BD;&#x3B1;&#x3B9;</span>, is in Cicero always and in
  other writers nearly always followed by a pronoun. For the form of the
  sentence here cf. Fam. 7, 1, 3 <i>ne ... nostrum</i>; Tusc. 3, 8 <i>ne
  ista</i> etc.; Fin. 3, 11 (almost the same words). &mdash; <b>per
  stadium</b>: 'over the course'; cf. Athenaeus 10. 4, p. 412 E; Lucian,
  Charon, 8; Quint. 1, 9, 5 <i>Milo quem vitulum assueverat ferre,
  taurum ferebat</i>. As to Milo see <a href="#Snot_27">n. on 27</a>. For
  <i>cum sustineret</i> a modern would have been inclined to use a
  participle, which was perhaps avoided here because of the close proximity
  of another participle, <i>ingressus</i>. &mdash; <b>umeris</b>: this
  spelling is better than <i>humeris</i>, which is now abandoned by the
  best scholars. There is no sound corresponding to the <i>h</i> in words
  of the same origin in cognate languages (see Curtius, Greek Etym. 1, 423
  of the Eng. Trans.), and although undoubtedly <i>h</i> was wrongly
  attached to some Latin words, there is no evidence to show that this
  happened to <i>umerus</i>. &mdash; <b>has</b>: <i>i.e. Milonis</i>,
  corresponding to <i>Pythagorae</i>. &mdash; <b>Pythagorae</b>: chosen no
  doubt because tradition made Milo a Pythagorean; see <a

  sit</i> (cf. Plaut. Miles 170). For the ellipsis see <a
  href="#Snot_26">n. on 26</a>. &mdash; <b>denique</b>: 'in short'. &mdash;
  <b>utare</b>: the second person of the present subjunctive hortative is
  very rare, excepting when, as here, the command is general. Had the
  command been addressed to a particular person, Cicero might have written
  <i>ne requisieris</i>. Cf. Madvig, Opusc. 2, 105; Roby, 1596; A. 266,
  <i>a, b</i>; G. 256, 2; H. 484, 4, n. 2. &mdash; <b>dum adsit, cum
  absit</b>: as both <i>dum</i> and <i>cum</i> evidently have here a
  temporal sense, the subjunctives seem due to the influence of the other
  subjunctives <i>utare</i> and <i>requiras</i>. A. 342; G. 666; H. 529,
  II. and n. 1, 1). &mdash; <b>nisi forte</b>: see <a href="#Snot_18">n. on

  href="#Snot_5">n. on 5</a>. &mdash; <b>eaque</b>: this is a common way of
  introducing with emphasis a fresh epithet or predicate. Often
  <i>idque</i> (<span lang="el" title="kai touto">&#x3BA;&#x3B1;&#x3B9;
  &#x3C4;&#x3BF;&#x3C5;&#x3C4;&#x3BF;</span>) occurs, the pronoun being then
  adverbially used, and not in agreement with the subject. Cf. <a
  href="#Snot_65">n. on 65</a> <i>illius quidem</i>; also <i>neque ea</i>
  in <a href="#Sect_22">22</a>. &mdash; <b>simplex</b>: life is compared to
  a race, in which each man has to run once and only once around the
  course. &mdash; <b>tempestivitas</b>: 'seasonableness'; cf. <a
  href="#Sect_5">5</a> <i>maturitate tempestiva</i>, with <a
  href="#Snot_5">n.</a> &mdash; <b>infirmitas</b>: the context shows that
  not physical but intellectual weakness is meant; so in Acad. 2, 9
  <i>infirmissimo tempore aetatis</i>; Fin. 5, 43 <i>aetas infirma</i>.
  &mdash; <b>ferocitas</b>: 'exultation', 'high spirit'. &mdash; <b>iam
  constantis aetatis</b>: <i>i.e.</i> middle age, the characteristic of
  which is <i>stability</i>; cf. <a href="#Sect_76">76</a> <i>constans
  aetas quae media dicitur</i>; also 60; Tac. A. 6, 46 <i>composita

  <p><b><a name="Snot_34"></a><a href="#Sect_34">34.</a> audire te

  <a href="#Snot_28">n. on 28</a> <i>orator</i>. &mdash; <b>avitus</b>:
  there was a strong friendship between the elder Africanus and Masinissa,
  king of Numidia, who in 206 B.C. passed over from the Carthaginian
  alliance to that of the Romans. He was richly rewarded by Scipio, and
  remained loyal to Rome till his death. He lived to welcome the younger
  Scipio in Africa during the last Punic war, and to see the utter ruin of
  Carthage. See Sall. Iug. 5, 4. For the expression <i>hospes tuus
  avitus</i> cf. Plautus, Miles 135 <i>paternum suom hospitem</i>. &mdash;
  <b>cum ingressus</b> etc.: <i>i.e.</i> protracted exercise of one kind
  did not weary him. &mdash; <b>cum ... equo</b>: though Cic. says <i>in
  equo vehi, esse, sedere</i> etc. the preposition here is left out because
  a mere ablative of manner or means is required to suit the similar
  ablative <i>pedibus</i>. So Div. 2, 140 <i>equus in quo vehebar</i>, 'the
  horse on which I rode'; but ib. 1, 58 <i>equo advectus ad ripam</i>,
  'brought to the bank <i>by the aid</i> of a horse'. &mdash;
  <b>siccitatem</b>: 'wiriness', literally 'dryness' or freedom from
  excessive perspiration, colds and the like; cf. Tusc. 5, 99 <i>siccitatem
  quae consequitur continentiam in victu</i>; Catull. 23, 12 <i>corpora
  sicciora cornu</i>. &mdash; <b>regis</b>: here = <i>regia</i>. &mdash;
  <b>officia et munera</b>: see <a href="#Snot_29">n. on 29</a>. &mdash;
  <b>ne sint</b>: 'grant that age has no strength'. This formula of
  concession for argument's sake is frequent in Cicero, who often attaches
  to it <i>sane</i>. A. 266, <i>d</i>; G. 610; H. 515, III. &mdash;
  <b>senectute</b> = <i>senibus</i>: see <a href="#Snot_26">n. on 26</a>.
  &mdash; <b>legibus et institutis</b>: 'by statute and precedent'. &mdash;
  <b>muneribus eis</b> etc.: chiefly military service. &mdash; <b>non modo
  ... sed ne quidem</b>: when a negative follows <i>non modo</i> these
  words have the force of <i>non modo non</i>, a negative being borrowed
  from the negative in the subsequent clause. But often <i>non modo non</i>
  is written; the negative after modo is then more emphatic, being
  independent. Here <i>non modo non quod non</i> would have had a harsh
  sound. A. 149, <i>e</i>; G. 484, 3 and Rem. 1.; H. 552, 2. &mdash;
  <b>quod</b>: adv. acc. (see <a href="#Snot_1">n. on 1</a> <i>quid</i>).
  Cf. Liv. 6, 15 <i>sed vos id cogendi estis</i>.</p>

  <p><b><a name="Snot_35"></a><a href="#Sect_35">35.</a> at</b>: as in <a
  href="#Sect_21">21</a>, where see <a href="#Snot_21">n.</a> In his reply
  Cato adopts the same form as that in which the objection is urged, <i>at
  id quidem</i> etc. So in 68 <i>at senex ... at est ...</i></p>

  <p><b>P. <a href="#Page_15">15</a> &mdash; commune valetudinis</b>:
  'common to weak health', i.e. to all in a weak state of health.
  <i>Valetudo</i> means in itself neither good nor bad health; the word
  takes its coloring from the context. &mdash; <b>filius is qui</b>: a
  pause must be made at <i>filius</i>; the sense is not 'that son of
  Africanus who adopted you', but 'the son of Africanus, I mean the man
  who adopted you'. &mdash; <b>quod ni ita fuisset</b>: 'now if this had
  not been so'; a phrase like <i>quod cum ita sit</i> and <i>hoc ita
  dici</i>. Cf. also <a href="#Sect_67">67</a> <i>quod ni ita
  accideret</i>; 82 <i>quod ni ita se haberet</i>. &mdash; <b>alterum ...
  civitatis</b>: <i>illud</i> is put for <i>ille</i>, by attraction to
  <i>lumen</i>. Roby, 1068. A. 195, <i>d</i>; G. 202, Rem. 5; H. 445, 4.
  Cf. Fin. 2, 70 <i>Epicurus, hoc enim vestrum lumen est</i>, 'Epicurus,
  for <i>he</i> is your shining light'. &mdash; <b>vitia</b>: 'defects'.
  &mdash; <b>diligentia</b>: scarcely corresponds to our 'diligence'; it
  rather implies minute, patient attention; 'painstaking'.</p>

  <p><b><a name="Snot_36"></a><a href="#Sect_36">36.</a> habenda ...
  valetudinis</b>: 'attention must be paid to health'; so <i>valetudini
  consulere</i> (Fam. 16, 4, 3) <i>operam dare</i> (De Or. I, 265)
  <i>indulgere</i> (Fam. 16, 18, 1) <i>valetudinem curare</i> often; cf.
  also Fam. 10, 35, 2; Fin. 2, 64. &mdash; <b>tantum</b>: restrictive, =
  'only so much'; so in 69, and often. &mdash; <b>potionis</b>: <i>cibus et
  potio</i> is the regular Latin equivalent for our 'food and drink'; see
  below, <a href="#Sect_46">46</a>; also Tusc. 5, 100; Fin. 1, 37; Varro de
  Re Rust. 1, 1, 5. &mdash; <b>adhibendum</b>: <i>adhibere</i> has here
  merely the sense of 'to employ' or 'to use'. Cf. Fin. 2, 64. &mdash;
  <b>non</b>: we should say 'and not' or 'but not'; the Latins, however,
  are fond of <i>asyndeton</i>, called <i>adversativum</i>, when two
  clauses are contrasted. &mdash; <b>menti ... animo</b>: properly
  <i>mens</i> is the intellect, strictly so called, <i>animus</i> intellect
  and feeling combined, but the words are often very loosely used. They
  often occur together in Latin; Lucretius has even <i>mens animi</i>.
  &mdash; <b>instilles</b>: see <a href="#Snot_21">n. on 21</a>
  <i>exerceas</i>. &mdash; <b>et</b>: 'moreover'. &mdash;
  <b>exercitando</b>: in good Latin the verb <i>exercitare</i> is rare
  except in <i>exercitatus</i>, which stands as participle to <i>exerceo,
  exercitus</i> being unused. The word seems to have been chosen here as
  suiting <i>exercitationibus</i> better than <i>exercendo</i> would. So in
  <a href="#Sect_47">47</a> <i>desideratio</i> is chosen rather than
  <i>desiderium</i>, to correspond with the neighboring <i>titillatio</i>.
  &mdash; <b>ait</b>: <i>sc. esse</i>; the omission with <i>aio</i> is
  rare, though common with <i>dico, appello</i> etc.; see <a
  href="#Snot_22">n. on 22</a>. &mdash; <b>comicos</b>: not 'comic' in our
  sense, but = <i>in comoediis</i>, 'represented in comedy'. So Rosc. Am.
  47 <i>comicum adulescentem</i>, 'the young man of comedy'. The passage of
  Caecilius (see <a href="#Snot_24">n. on 24</a> <i>Statius</i>) is more
  fully quoted in Lael. 99. &mdash; <b>credulos</b>: in almost every Latin
  comedy there is some old man who is cheated by a cunning slave. &mdash;
  <b>somniculosae</b>: the adj. contains a diminutive noun stem
  (<i>somniculo-</i>). &mdash; <b>petulantia</b>: 'waywardness'. &mdash;
  <b>non proborum</b>: Cic. avoids <i>improborum</i> as being too harsh;
  with exactly similar feeling Propertius 3, 20, 52 (ed. Paley) says <i>nec
  proba Pasiphae</i> for <i>et improba P.</i> Cf. Off. 3, 36 <i>error
  hominum non proborum</i>. &mdash; <b>ista</b>: implying contempt. A. 102,
  <i>c</i>; G. 291, Rem.; H. 450, 1. n. and foot-note 4. &mdash;
  <b>deliratio</b>: 'dotage'; a rare word, used by Cic. only here and in
  Div. 2, 90.</p>

  <p><b><a name="Snot_37"></a><a href="#Sect_37">37.</a> robustos</b>:
  'sturdy'; implying that the sons were grown up. &mdash; <b>tantam</b>:
  <i>sc. quantam habuit</i>; only a little more emphatic than <i>magnam</i>
  would have been; see <a href="#Snot_52">n. on 52</a>. &mdash;
  <b>Appius</b>: see <a href="#Snot_16">n. on 16</a>. &mdash;
  <b>regebat</b>: the <i>pater familias</i> in early Roman times was an
  almost irresponsible ruler over his children and household. For a full
  discussion of the <i>patria potestas</i> see Coulanges, Ancient City, Bk.
  II. Ch. 8; Maine, Ancient Law, Ch. 5; Hadley, Introd. to Roman Law,
  Chapters 5 and 6. &mdash; <b>et ... senex</b>: 'though both blind and
  old'. &mdash; <b>intentum</b>: commonly used of <i>animus</i>, like the
  opposite <i>remissus</i> (28). &mdash; <b>tenebat</b> etc.: the <i>patria
  potestas</i> is often denoted by the word <i>imperium</i>; cf. De Invent.
  2, 140 <i>imperium domesticum</i>. &mdash; <b>vigebat</b> etc.: 'in him
  ancestral spirit and principles were strong'. While <i>animus patrius</i>
  here evidently means the strong will for which the patrician Claudii were
  proverbial (as <i>e.g.</i> in Rosc. Am. 46 <i>intellegere qui animus
  patrius sit in liberos</i>) it indicates the feeling of a particular
  father for his children.</p>

  <p><b>P. <a href="#Page_16">16</a> &mdash; <a name="Snot_38"></a><a
  href="#Sect_38">38.</a> ita</b>: = <i>ea lege</i> 'on these conditions,
  viz. ...', the clause with <i>si</i> being an explanation of <i>ita</i>.
  This correspondence of <i>ita ... si</i> is common in Cicero; see <a
  href="#Snot_12">n. on 12</a> <i>ita ... quasi</i>. Here translate 'age
  can only be in honor if it fights for itself'. &mdash; <b>se ipsa</b>:
  cf. Cic. Acad. 2, 36 <i>veritas se ipsa defendet</i>; see also the <a
  href="#Snot_4">n. on 4</a>. &mdash; <b>si ... est</b>: 'if it has passed
  into bondage to nobody'. <i>Mancipium</i> is a piece of property;
  <i>emancipare</i> is to pass a piece of property out of its owner's
  hands. The word acquired two exactly opposite meanings. When used of a
  slave, or of a son <i>in patria potestate</i>, who was legally subject to
  many of the same ordinances as a slave, it means 'to set free', unless,
  as in Fin. I, 24 <i>filium in adoptionem D. Silano emancipaverat</i>,
  some person is mentioned to whom the original owner makes over his
  rights. But in Plaut. Bacchid. 1, 1, 90 <i>mulier, tibi me emancupo</i>
  the sense is 'I enslave myself to you', <i>i.e.</i> 'I pass myself out of
  my own power into yours'. So in the well-known passage of Horace, Epod.
  9, 12 (of Antony) <i>emancipatus feminae</i> 'enslaved to a woman'; cf
  Cic. Phil. 2, 51 <i>venditum atque emancipatum tribunatum</i>. &mdash;
  <b>senile aliquid ... aliquid adulescentis</b>: chiasmus. For the sense
  cf. <a href="#Sect_33">33</a> <i>ferocitas iuvenum ... senectutis
  maturitas</i>. &mdash; <b>quod qui sequitur</b>: 'and he who strives
  after this', <i>i.e.</i> to combine the virtues of age and youth. Cf.

  as to Cato's literary labors see <a href="#Page_iv">Introd</a>. &mdash; <b>omnia colligo</b>:
  referring to the materials Cato was collecting for his 'Origines'.
  &mdash; <b>quascunque defendi</b>: 'as many as I have conducted'.
  <i>Defendere causam</i> here is simply to act as counsel in a case,
  whether the client be defendant or plaintiff. So in Lael. 96 and often.
  &mdash; <b>nunc cum maxime</b>: 'now more than ever',
  <span

  &#x3BC;&#x3B1;&#x3BB;&#x3B9;&#x3C3;&#x3C4;&#x3B1;</span>.
  The phrase is elliptic; in full it would be '<i>cum maxime conficio
  orationes, nunc conficio</i>', 'when I most of all compose speeches, I
  now compose them'; <i>i.e.</i> 'the time when I most of all compose is
  now'. The words <i>cum maxime</i> generally follow <i>tum</i> or
  <i>nunc</i> and add emphasis to those words, but are sometimes used alone
  to express the ideas 'then' and 'now' more emphatically than <i>tum</i>
  and <i>nunc</i> would. Cf. Ver. 4, 82; Tac. Ann. 4, 27. The orators were
  in the habit of working over their speeches carefully for publication and
  preservation. &mdash; <b>ius augurium</b> etc.: 'the law pertaining to
  the augurs and pontifices'; <i>i.e.</i> the principles applied by them in
  the performance of their duties. The pontifices had the general oversight
  of religious observances. See Dict. of Antiq. &mdash; <b>civile</b>: the
  meaning of <i>ius civile</i> varies according to the context. Here it is
  the secular law as opposed to the sacred law, as in <a
  href="#Sect_50">50</a>; sometimes it is the whole body of Roman law as
  opposed to the law of other states; often, again, it is the older portion
  of the Roman law as opposed to the newer or 'equity' portion. &mdash;
  <b>commemoro</b>: 'I say over to myself'. In Cicero <i>commemoro</i> is a
  verb of speaking, and never has the meaning of <i>recordor</i> or
  <i>memini</i>. &mdash; <b>curricula</b>: see <a href="#Snot_33">nn. on
  33</a>. &mdash; <b>magno opere</b>: better so written than in one word
  <i>magnopere</i>; so <i>maximo, minimo, nimio opere</i>. &mdash; <b>adsum
  amicis</b>: 'I act as counsel to my friends'. This legal sense of
  <i>adesse</i> is common. &mdash; <b>frequens</b>: literally the word
  means 'crowded' (connected with <i>farcire</i> 'to cram' or 'to crowd
  together'), hence <i>frequens senatus</i> and the like phrases. Then
  <i>frequens</i> comes to be used of actions or events that often recur;
  <i>e.g.</i> Orat. 15 <i>Demosthenes frequens Platonis auditor</i>; De Or.
  1, 243 <i>frequens te audivi</i>. On the use of the adj. here see A. 191;
  G. 324, Rem. 6; H. 443. &mdash; <b>ultro</b>: 'unasked', 'of my own
  motion', a reference to the well-known story that, whatever subject was
  discussed, Cato gave as his opinion '<i>delenda est Carthago</i>'. See
  <a href="#Page_xix">Introd</a>. &mdash; <b>tueor</b>: 'advocate', 'support'. &mdash;
  <b>lectulus</b>: a couch usually stood in the Roman study, on which the
  student reclined while reading, composing or dictating, or
  even writing. Cf. De Or. 3, 17, <i>in eam exedram venisse in qua Crassus
  lectulo posito recubuisset, cumque eum in cogitatione defixum esse
  sensisset, statim recessisse ...</i>; Suet. Aug. 78 <i>lecticula
  lucubratoria</i>. &mdash; <b>ea ipsa cogitantem</b>: = <i>de eis ipsis
  cog.</i>: so Acad. 2, 127 <i>cogitantes supera atque caelestia</i>, and
  often. &mdash; <b>acta vita</b>: 'the life I have led'; cf. <a
  href="#Sect_62">62</a> <i>honeste acta superior aetas</i>; so Tusc. 1,
  109; Fam. 4, 13, 4. &mdash; <b>viventi</b>: dative of reference. A. 235;
  G. 354; H. 384, 4, n. 3. 'As regards one who lives amid these pursuits
  and tasks'. &mdash; <b>ita sensim</b> etc.: <i>sensim sine sensu</i>
  (observe the alliteration) is like <i>mentes dementis</i> in <a
  href="#Sect_16">16</a>, where see <a href="#Snot_16">n.</a> <i>Sensim</i>
  must have meant at one time 'perceptibly', then 'only just perceptibly',
  then 'gradually' and almost 'imperceptibly'.</p>

  <p><b><a name="Snot_39"></a><a href="#Sect_39">39.</a> quod ...
  dicunt</b>: not strictly logical, being put for <i>quod careat, ut
  dicunt</i>. In cases like this the verb of saying is usually in the
  subjunctive. Cf. Roby, 1746; A. 341, Rem.; G. 541, Rem. 2; H. 516, II. 1.
  The indicative here is more vivid and forcible. &mdash; <b>munus ...
  aufert</b>: to say that a gift robs one of anything is of course an
  <i>oxymoron</i>; cf. <a href="#Snot_16">n. on 16</a> <i>mentes
  dementis</i>. &mdash; <b>aetatis</b>: almost = <i>senectutis</i>: cf. <a
  href="#Snot_45">n. on 45</a>. &mdash; <b>id quod est</b> etc.: 'the
  greatest fault of youth'; <i>i.e.</i> the love of pleasure. In this
  passage <i>voluptas</i> indicates pleasure of a sensual kind, its
  ordinary sense, <i>delectatio, oblectatio</i> etc. being used of the
  higher pleasures. In <a href="#Sect_51">51</a>, however, we have
  <i>voluptates agricolarum</i>. &mdash; <b>accipite</b>: 'hear'; so
  <i>dare</i> often means 'to tell'. With <i>accipere</i> in this sense cf.
  the similar use of
  <span lang="el"

  &mdash; <b>Archytae</b>: Archytas (the subject of Horace's well-known
  ode, 1, 28) was a contemporary and friend of Plato, and a follower of the
  Pythagorean philosophy. He wrote philosophical works, and was also famous
  as a mathematician and astronomer, besides being the leading statesman
  and general of the commonwealth of Tarentum. For another saying of
  Archytas, cf. Lael. 88. &mdash; <b>tradita est</b>: 'was imparted to me',
  <i>i.e.</i> by word of mouth. &mdash; <b>cum ... Tarenti</b>: 'when as a
  young man I stayed at Tarentum'. For <i>adulescens</i> cf. <a
  href="#Snot_26">n. on 26</a> <i>senes</i>. &mdash; <b>nullam ...
  pestem</b> etc.: cf. Lael. 34 <i>pestem ... cupiditatem</i>; Off. 2, 9
  <i>consuetudo ... honestatem ab utilitate secernens, qua nulla pernicies
  maior hominum vitae potuit afferri</i>. &mdash; <b>capitaliorem</b>:
  'more deadly'; <i>caput</i> was often equivalent to <i>vita</i>, so that
  <i>capitalis</i> comes to mean 'affecting the life'.</p>

  <p><b>P. <a href="#Page_17">17</a> &mdash; <a name="Snot_40"></a><a

  turpe damnum, quod dedecus est quod non evocetur atque eliciatur
  voluptate?</i> Observe the singular <i>patriae</i> followed by
  the plural <i>rerum publicarum</i>; the plural of <i>patria</i> is rare.
  On the significance of this passage see Lecky, Hist. of European Morals,
  I. p. 211, n. (Am. ed.). &mdash; <b>cum hostibus</b> etc.: attributive
  phrase; cf. Phil. 12, 27 <i>colloquia cum acerrimis hostibus</i>. &mdash;
  <b>scelus</b>: this word looks chiefly to the criminal intention, whether
  it be carried into action or not, <i>malum</i>, <i>facinus</i> to the
  completed crime; <i>flagitium</i> is sin rather than crime,
  <i>Facinus</i> in sense is often rather narrower and lighter than
  <i>scelus</i>; cf. Verr. 5, 170 <i>facinus est vincire civem Romanum,
  scelus verberare, prope parricidium necare</i>. &mdash;
  <b>impelleret</b>: <i>sc. homines</i>; so <i>nos</i> is omitted after
  <i>iubebat</i> below. &mdash; <b>excitari</b>: 'stirred up'. In <a
  href="#Sect_39">39</a> and <a href="#Sect_41">41</a> we have the verb
  <i>in-citare</i>; for the difference between the two verbs cf. Qu. Fr. 1,
  1, 45 <i>haec non eo dicuntur, ut te oratio mea dormientem excitasse, sed
  potius ut currentem incitasse videatur</i>. &mdash; <b>homini ...
  dedisset</b>: cf. Acad. 1, 7 <i>nec ullum arbitror maius aut melius a dis
  datum munus homini</i>. Notice <i>homini</i> 'man', in the same sense as
  <i>hominibus</i>, above. &mdash; <b>muneri ac dono</b>: the two words
  <i>munus</i> and <i>donum</i> are often found together; the difference in
  meaning is hardly perceptible. <i>Donum</i> implies the fact of giving,
  <i>munus</i> the generosity of the giver. &mdash; <b>tam ...
  inimicum</b>: notice the separation of <i>tam</i> from
  <i>inimicum</i>.</p>

  <b>consistere</b>: 'find a foothold'. Cf. Fin. 4, 69 <i>sapientia pedem
  ubi poneret non habebat</i>. &mdash; <b>fingere animo</b>: 'to imagine'.
  &mdash; <b>tanta ... quanta ... maxima</b>: 'the greatest that could
  possibly be enjoyed'. The form of expression is common, <i>e.g.</i> Lael.
  74 <i>tanta quanta maxima potest esse distantia</i>. &mdash; <b>tam diu
  dum</b>: this is not exactly equivalent to the ordinary <i>tam diu
  quam</i>, but there is ellipsis &mdash; 'so long as this, I mean while,
  etc.'. Cf. Cat. 3, 16 <i>tam diu, dum urbis moenibus continebatur</i>;
  Off. 1, 2 <i>tam diu ... quoad ...</i> &mdash; <b>mente ... ratione ...
  cogitatione</b>: 'by thought, by reasoning, by imagination'.
  <i>Cogitatio</i> like
  <span lang="el"
  title="dianoia">&#x3B4;&#x3B9;&#x3B1;&#x3BD;&#x3BF;&#x3B9;&#x3B1;</span> has often the sense
  of 'imagination'. The close juxtaposition of words nearly synonymous is
  quite characteristic of Cicero's Latin. &mdash; <b>quidem</b>:
  concessive, as in <a href="#Sect_32">32</a> and often. &mdash; <b>maior
  atque longior</b>: 'very intense and protracted'. Superlatives might have
  been expected, in view of <i>quanta percipi posset maxima</i> above.
  <i>Longus</i> in the sense of 'long-continued' is rare in Ciceronian
  Latin, excepting when, as in 66 <i>longa aetate</i>, it is joined with a
  word distinctly referring to time. For the general
  drift of the passage cf. Cic. Hortensius (fragment) <i>congruere cum
  cogitatione magna voluptas corporis non potest; quis enim, cum utatur
  voluptate ea qua nulla possit maior esse, attendere animum, inire
  rationes, cogitare omnino quidquam potest</i>? &mdash; <b>animi
  lumen</b>: a common metaphor; <i>e.g.</i> Cic. Rep. 6, 12 <i>tu,
  Africane, ostendas oportebit patriae lumen animi tui</i>. Cf. 36 <i>haec
  ... exstinguuntur</i>; also below, <a href="#Sect_42">42</a> <i>mentis
  oculos</i>. &mdash; <b>C. Pontio</b>: C. Pontius Herennius, the father of
  C. Pontius Telesinus who defeated the Romans at the Caudine Forks during
  the Second Samnite war, in 321 B.C. The father is several times mentioned
  by Livy 9, cc. 1 and 3; cf. especially 1, § 2 <i>C. Pontium, patre longe
  prudentissimo natum</i>. &mdash; <b>Nearchus</b>: mentioned by Plutarch,
  Cato 2, as a Pythagorean and friend of Cato. &mdash; <b>permanserat</b>:
  <i>i.e.</i> during the siege of Tarentum. &mdash; <b>interfuisset</b>:
  not in accordance with English idiom; cf. <a href="#Snot_4">n. on 4</a>
  <i>putassent</i>; also <a href="#Sect_44">44</a> <i>devicerat</i>.
  &mdash; <b>Plato</b> etc.: although Plato made two journeys to Italy and
  Sicily (or, as some authorities say, three) it is scarcely likely that he
  was present at Tarentum in the year mentioned, 349 B.C., two years before
  his death, when he was of advanced age. The latest date assigned by other
  authorities for Plato's last visit to the West is 361 B.C. &mdash;
  <b>reperio</b>: <i>sc. in annalibus</i>; so in <a href="#Sect_15">15</a>;
  cf. <i>videmus</i> in <a href="#Sect_26">26</a>.</p>

  <p><b><a name="Snot_42"></a><a href="#Sect_42">42.</a> efficeret</b>:
  <i>efficeret, liberet</i>, and <i>oporteret</i> can be properly rendered
  into English only by the present tense. Although these verbs express
  circumstances which <i>continue</i>, since the general effect of old age
  is being described, they are thrown into the past to suit the past tense
  <i>dicebam</i> or <i>dixi</i> which, though not expressed, is really the
  principal verb. Cf. below, <a href="#Sect_62">62</a>, <a
  href="#Sect_78">78</a>. &mdash; <b>consilium</b>: 'deliberation'.</p>

  <p><b>P. <a href="#Page_18">18</a> &mdash; ut ita dicam</b>: this softens
  the metaphor, as <i>quasi</i> or <i>quasi quidam</i> often does, and as
  <span lang="el"
  title="hoion">&#x201B;&#x3BF;&#x3B9;&#x3BF;&#x3BD;</span>, <span

  &#x3B5;&#x3B9;&#x3C0;&#x3B5;&#x3B9;&#x3BD;</span>, which is often wrongly said
  to be the equivalent of <i>ut ita dicam</i>; see n. on Lael. 2]. The
  phrase <i>mentis</i> or <i>animi aciem praestringere</i> often occurs
  without anything to soften the metaphor; <i>e.g.</i> Fin. 4, 37. &mdash;
  <b>nec habet</b> etc: 'and has no relations with virtue'. The use of
  <i>commercium</i> in the metaphorical sense is common. &mdash;
  <b>invitus</b>: see ref. on 38 <i>frequens</i>. &mdash; <b>feci ut</b>: a
  periphrasis not unusual. A. 332, <i>e</i>; G. 557; H. 498, II. n. 2.
  &mdash; <b>T. Flaminini</b>: see <a href="#Snot_1">n. on 1</a>, l. 1.
  &mdash; <b>L. Flamininum</b>: as prætor he commanded the fleet under his
  brother Titus during the Macedonian war; in 192 B.C. he was consul.
  <i>Septem annis</i> denotes seven <i>complete</i> years (cf. <a
  href="#Snot_19">n. on 19</a>), as Cato was censor in
  184. A reference to Livy 39, 43, 2 will show that Cicero borrows his
  account of Flamininus' crime from the old annalist Valerius Antias. Livy
  also quotes (39, 42, 7) an account of the matter given by Cato himself in
  a speech, which is even more disgraceful to Flamininus. &mdash;
  <b>eicerem</b>: the phrase commonly used is not <i>eicere</i>, but
  <i>movere, aliquem senatu. Notare</i> and <i>nota (censoria)</i> are
  technically used of degradation or disfranchisement inflicted by the
  censors. For the spelling see Roby, 144, 2; A. 10, <i>d</i>; H. 36, 4 and
  footnote 1. &mdash; <b>fuisset</b>: for the mood see A. 342; G. 666; H.
  529, II. and n. 1, 1); for the tense see Roby, 1491; A. 324, <i>a</i>; G.
  233, 2; H. 471, 4. &mdash; <b>cum ... Gallia</b>: not 'when he was consul
  in Gaul' but 'when he was in Gaul during his consulship'. <i>Cum</i> with
  the imperfect or pluperfect subjunctive often has a sense differing very
  little from that of <i>cum</i> with the imperfect or pluperfect
  indicative. No doubt when the usage originally arose, the clause with
  <i>cum</i> was regarded as expressing the <i>cause</i> of the action or
  event denoted by the principal verb; here the presence of F. in Gaul
  might be regarded as <i>a cause</i> of the crime. It is more than
  doubtful, however, whether in actual use the subjunctive in these phrases
  continued to carry with it to Latin readers any idea of cause. See Roby,
  1720, Kennedy, 211; also A. 325, 323 and footnote 1; G. 586 with Rem.; H.
  521, II. 2 and footnote 1. &mdash; <b>exoratus est</b>: 'was persuaded';
  cf. Liv. 39, 43. &mdash; <b>securi feriret</b>: the story was that L.
  Flamininus himself acted as executioner. &mdash; <b>eorum qui ...
  essent</b>: the subjunctive because of the class-notion, 'of such persons
  as were'. &mdash; <b>Tito censore</b>: <i>i.e.</i> in 189 B.C.; see <a
  href="#Snot_1">n. on 1</a>. &mdash; <b>Flacco</b>: L. Valerius Flaccus
  was the life-long friend of Cato, and his colleague in the consulship and
  in the censorship. He entirely favored Cato's political views. See
  <a
  href="#Page_xvi">Introd</a>. &mdash; <b>imperi dedecus</b>: Flamininus was at the time Roman
  governor of the district.</p>

  <p><b><a name="Snot_43"></a><a href="#Sect_43">43.</a> audivi e</b>: Cic.
  uses <i>audire ex, ab</i>, and <i>de aliquo</i>, almost indifferently.
  &mdash; <b>porro</b>: 'in turn'; literally 'farther on', here = 'farther
  back'; cf. Livy 27, 51. &mdash; <b>C. Fabricium</b>: see <a
  href="#Snot_15">n. on 15</a>. &mdash; <b>Cinea</b>: the famous
  diplomatist, minister of Pyrrhus. He was a pupil of Demosthenes and
  himself one of the most famous orators of his time. Cineas was the
  ambassador who tried to negotiate peace on the occasion mentioned in <a
  href="#Sect_16">16</a>. &mdash; <b>se sapientem profiteretur</b>: the
  omission of <i>esse</i> is common in such phrases; <i>e.g.</i> Fin. 5, 13
  <i>Strato physicum se voluit</i>. Epicurus, who is here meant (born 342
  B.C., died 270), was blamed for calling himself
  <span lang="el" title="sophos">&#x3C3;&#x3BF;&#x3C6;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span> or <i>sapiens</i>. Others,
  says Cicero, who had borne the title had waited for the
  public to confer it on them (Fin. 2, 7). &mdash; <b>eumque</b>: 'and yet
  he'; cf. <a href="#Snot_13">n. on 13</a> <i>vixitque</i>. &mdash;
  <b>faceremus</b>: for the tense cf. <a href="#Snot_42">n. on 42</a>
  <i>efficeret</i>; also <i>expeteretur</i> below. &mdash; <b>ad ...
  referenda</b>: 'ought to be judged by the standard of pleasure',
  <i>i.e.</i> anything which brings pleasure may be regarded as good, and
  its opposite bad. So in Greek
  <span
  lang="el" title="epanapherein ti eis ti">&#x3B5;&#x3C0;&#x3B1;&#x3BD;&#x3B1;&#x3C6;&#x3B5;&#x3C1;&#x3B5;&#x3B9;&#x3BD;
  &#x3C4;&#x3B9; &#x3B5;&#x3B9;&#x3C2; &#x3C4;&#x3B9;</span>. On the moral
  teachings of Epicurus consult Zeller, Stoics, Epicureans, and Sceptics,
  Ch. 19; Ueberweg, History of Philosophy, § 59; Guyan, La morale d'Épicure
  et ses rapports avec les doctrines contemporaines. &mdash; <b>Curium ...
  Coruncanium</b>: see <a href="#Snot_15">n. on 15</a>. &mdash; <b>id ...
  persuaderetur</b>: intransitive verbs are used in the passive only
  impersonally (Roby, 1422; A. 230; G. 199, Rem. 1; H. 301, 1); when so
  used the dative may follow as in the active (see Madvig, 244, <i>b</i>;
  G. 208; H. 384, 5). A neuter pronoun in the singular sometimes, as here,
  accompanies the passive, and may be regarded as an adverbial accusative
  of respect or extent, or as a nominative qualifying the impersonal
  subject. The former is probably the real construction. Cf. Roby, 1423,
  and Madvig, 229, <i>b</i>, Obs. 1. &mdash; <b>Samnitibus</b>: then in
  alliance with Pyrrhus. &mdash; <b>vixerat ... cum</b>: not to be taken
  literally of living in the same house; the phrase merely indicates close
  friendship. In Acad. 2, 115 Cic. writes <i>Diodoto qui mecum vivit tot
  annos, qui habitat apud me</i>, clearly showing that the phrases
  <i>vivere cum aliquo</i> and <i>habitare apud aliquem</i> are not
  equivalent. &mdash; <b>P. Decio</b>: this is P. Decius Mus, who at the
  battle of Sentinum in 295 gave his life as a propitiatory offering to the
  powers of the unseen world, in order to bring victory to the Roman arms.
  His father had sacrificed himself in the same way at the battle of
  Veseris (close to Vesuvius) in 340, fought against the Latins and
  Campanians. &mdash; <b>devoverat</b>: Liv. 10, 28, 13 (speech of Decius)
  <i>datum hoc: nostro generi est ut luendis periculis publicis piacula
  simus; iam ego mecum hostium legiones mactandas Telluri et dis Manibus
  dabo</i>. &mdash; <b>aliquid</b> etc.: 'some principle'; in his
  philosophical works Cicero often confounds the Epicureans by quoting the
  action of the Decii and others like it, as showing that pleasure is not
  the end of existence. Cf. especially Fin. 2, 61 <i>P. Decius cum se
  devoverat et equo admisso in mediam aciem Latinorum irruebat, aliquid de
  voluptatibus suis cogitabat?</i> Cf. also below, <a
  href="#Sect_75">75</a>. With regard to <i>natura</i> see <a
  href="#Snot_5">n. on 5</a>. &mdash; <b>sua sponte</b>: 'for its own
  sake'; 'on its own account'. Cf. Leg. 1, 45 <i>vera et falsa sua sponte
  non aliena iudicantur</i>, where a few lines later <i>sua natura</i>
  occurs as equivalent to <i>sua sponte</i>. &mdash;
  <b>ex peteretur</b>: em. for <i>peteretur</i> in the MSS. The words
  <i>expetere</i>, <i>expetendum</i> are technically used in Cicero's
  philosophical works to express the Greek

  the root of <i>edo</i>). Plato in the Timaeus 69 D (a dialogue translated
  into Latin by Cicero, a fragment of whose translation is still preserved)
  has <span lang="el" title="hêdonên megiston kakou delear">&#x201B;&#x3B7;&#x3B4;&#x3BF;&#x3BD;&#x3B7;&#x3BD;

  a Platone dictae sunt illecebrae esse atque escae malorum</i>. &mdash;
  <b>modicis</b>: for the sake of variety Cic. chooses this, not
  <i>moderatis</i>, as the opposite of <i>immoderatis</i>. Trans. 'a
  moderate amount of goodfellowship'. &mdash; M.F. = <i>Marci filium</i>.
  &mdash; <b>devicerat</b>: pluperfect where a modern would incline to use
  a perfect. The battle referred to is that of Mylae, fought in 260; its
  memory was perpetuated by the decking of the <i>forum</i> with the
  <i>rostra</i> of the captured ships; the <i>columna rostrata</i> bore a
  long inscription, a restored version of which still exists. &mdash;
  <b>cena</b>: so best spelt; some good texts still print <i>caena</i>, but
  <i>coena</i> is decidedly wrong, being based on the fiction that the
  Latin borrowed the Greek word <span lang="el"
  title="koinê">&#x3BA;&#x3BF;&#x3B9;&#x3BD;&#x3B7;</span> and
  turned it into <i>coena</i>. &mdash; <b>cereo funali</b>: 'the
  torch-light'; <i>cereo</i>, the em. of Mommsen for <i>crebro</i>; the
  <i>funale</i> was a torch composed of withs or twigs twisted into a rope
  (<i>funis</i>) and dipped in pitch or oil. &mdash; <b>sibi ...
  sumpserat</b>: Cic. seems to think that Duillius assumed these honors on
  his own authority. This was probably not the case; they were most likely
  conferred on him by a vote of the <i>comitia tributa</i>. Cf. Liv. epit.
  17 <i>C. Duillius primus omnium Romanorum ducum navalis victoriae duxit
  triumphum, ob quam causam ei perpetuus quoque honos habitus est, ut
  revertenti a cena tibicine canente funale praeferretur</i>. No other
  instance is known where these particular distinctions were
  decreed; the nearest parallel lies in the right accorded to Paulus
  Macedonicus and to Pompeius to wear the triumphal <i>toga picta</i> for
  life on each occasion of the <i>ludi</i>. It may be conjectured that the
  music and the torch were part of the ceremony on the evening of a triumph
  when the <i>triumphator</i> was escorted home. Cf. Florus 1, 18, 10, ed.
  Halm. &mdash; <b>nullo exemplo</b>: 'without any precedent'. &mdash;
  <b>privatus</b>: any person is <i>privatus</i> who is not actually in
  office at the moment referred to, whether he has led a public life or
  not. &mdash; <b>licentiae</b>: a strong word is used to mark the
  heinousness of Duillius' supposed offence against ancestral custom.</p>

  <p><b><a name="Snot_45"></a><a href="#Sect_45">45.</a> alios</b>: <i>sc.
  nomino</i>. &mdash; <b>primum</b>: the corresponding <i>deinde</i> is
  omitted, as often. &mdash; <b>sodalis</b>: the <i>sodalitates</i> or
  <i>sodalitia</i>, brotherhoods for the perpetuation of certain rites
  accompanied with feasting, were immemorial institutions at Rome. The
  clause <i>sodalitates ... acceptis</i> must not be taken to mean that
  Cicero supposed these brotherhoods to have been first instituted in the
  time of Cato; it is only introduced to show that Cato, so far from being
  averse to good living, assisted officially in the establishment of new
  clubs. Most of the <i>sodalitates</i> were closely connected with the
  <i>gens</i>; all members of a <i>gens</i> were <i>sodales</i> and met
  together to keep up the old <i>sacra</i>, but in historical times
  fictitious kinship largely took the place of real kinship, and feasting
  became almost the sole raison d'être of these clubs. [See Mommsen's
  treatise <i>De collegiis et sodaliciis Romanis</i>] The parallel of the
  London City Companies readily suggests itself. The national
  <i>sodalitates</i> or priesthoods such as those of the <i>Sodales Titii,
  Luperci, Augustales</i> etc. were somewhat different. &mdash;
  <b>autem</b>: for the form of the parenthesis cf. 7. &mdash; <b>Magnae
  Matris</b>: the image of Cybele was brought to Rome in 204 B.C. from
  Pessinus in Phrygia. See Liv. 29, 10. The <i>Sacra</i> are called
  <i>Idaea</i> from Mount Ida in Phrygia, which was a great centre of the
  worship of Cybele. <i>Acceptis</i>, sc. <i>in civitatem</i>; the worship
  of strange gods was in principle illegal at Rome unless expressly
  authorized by the State. &mdash; <b>igitur</b>: the construction of the
  sentence is broken by the introduction of the parenthesis, and a fresh
  start is made with <i>epulabar igitur. Igitur</i> is often thus used,
  like our 'well then', to pick up the broken thread of a sentence. So
  often <i>sed</i> or <i>ergo</i>. &mdash; <b>fervor</b>: Cf. Hor. Od. 1,
  16, 22 <i>me quoque pectoris temptavit in dulci iuventa fervor</i>.
  &mdash; <b>aetatis, qua progrediente</b>: 'belonging to that time of
  life, but as life advances'. The word <i>aetas</i> has really two senses
  here; in the first place it is <i>bona aetas</i> or <i>iuventus</i>
  (cf. <a href="#Sect_39">39</a> where <i>aetas = senectus</i>), in the
  second place <i>vita</i> (for which see <a href="#Snot_5">n. on 5</a>).

  <p><b><a name="Snot_46"></a><a href="#Sect_46">46.</a> tempestivis ...
  conviviis</b>: 'even in protracted banquets'. Those banquets which began
  <i>early</i> in order that they might last long were naturally in bad
  repute, so that the phrase <i>tempestivum convivium</i> often has almost
  the sense of 'a debauch'. Thus in Att. 9, 1, 3 Cicero describes himself
  as being evil spoken of <i>in tempestivis conviviis, i.e.</i> in
  dissolute society. Cf. pro Arch. 13. The customary dinner hour at Rome
  was about three o'clock in the afternoon. The word <i>tempestivus</i>,
  which in <a href="#Sect_5">5</a> means 'at the right time', here means
  'before the right time'. So in English 'in good time' often means 'too
  early'. See Becker's Gallus, p. 451 <i>et seq</i>. &mdash; <b>qui
  pauci</b>: the substitution of the nominative of the relative for the
  partitive genitive (<i>quorum</i>) is not uncommon. A. 216, <i>e</i>; G.
  368, Rem. 2; H. 397, 2, n. &mdash; <b>pauci admodum</b>: Cic. usually
  says <i>admodum pauci</i> rather than <i>pauci admodum</i>. &mdash;
  <b>vestra aetate</b>: = <i>eis qui sunt vestra aetate</i>. Cf. <a
  href="#Snot_26">n. on 26</a> <i>senectus</i>. &mdash; <b>sermonis ...
  sustulit</b>: notice the indicatives <i>auxit, sustulit</i>, the relative
  clauses being attributive, though they might fairly have been expected
  here to be causal. G. 627; H. 517, 2. In this passage Cic. imitates
  Plato, Rep. 328 D. &mdash; <b>bellum indicere</b>: common in the
  metaphorical sense; <i>e.g.</i> De Or. 2, 155 <i>miror cur philosophiae
  prope bellum indixeris</i>; Hor. Sat. 1, 5, 7 <i>ventri indico
  bellum</i>. &mdash; <b>cuius est</b> etc.: <i>i.e.</i> nature sanctions a
  certain amount of pleasure. This is the Peripatetic notion of the
  <i>mean</i>, to which Cicero often gives expression, as below, 77; also
  in Acad. 1, 39; 2, 139; and in De Off.; so Hor. Sat. 1, 1, 106 <i>sunt
  certi denique fines quos ultra citraque nequit consistere rectum</i>; cf.
  Od. 2, 10. &mdash; <b>non intellego ne</b>: for the negatives cf. <a
  href="#Snot_24">nn. on 24</a>, 27.</p>

  <p><b>P. <a href="#Page_20">20</a> &mdash; magisteria</b>: generally
  explained as referring to the practice of appointing at each dinner a
  'master of the feast', <i>arbiter bibendi</i> or
  <span lang="el"
  title="symposiarchês">&#x3C3;&#x3C5;&#x3BC;&#x3C0;&#x3BF;&#x3C3;&#x3B9;&#x3B1;&#x3C1;&#x3C7;&#x3B7;&#x3C2;</span>.
  This explanation is not quite correct. Mommsen shows in his
  work '<i>de collegiis</i>' that each one of the <i>collegia</i> or
  <i>sodalicia</i> annually appointed a <i>magister cenarum</i> whose duty
  it was to attend to the club-dinners during his year of office and no
  doubt to preside at them. That some office is meant more important than
  that of the <i>arbiter bibendi</i> appointed for a particular feast is
  shown by the words <i>a maioribus instituta</i>. It is scarcely likely
  that Cicero was ignorant of the Greek origin of the custom of appointing
  an <i>arbiter bibendi</i>. &mdash; <b>et is sermo</b> etc.: 'and the kind
  of talk in which following the fashion of our fathers we engage,
  beginning at the upper table, as the cup goes round'. The cup circulated
  from left to right, not, as with us, from right to left. The guests at a
  Roman dinner reclined on three couches, placed at three tables; two of
  the couches (<i>lecti</i>) were parallel, and the third was at right
  angles to the other two. The <i>lectus</i> at which the cup began to
  circulate was <i>summus</i>, the next <i>medius</i>, the last
  <i>imus</i>. For a <i>summo</i> cf. <i>da (sc. bibere) a summo</i> in
  Plaut. Asin. 5, 2, 41. See Becker's Gallus, p. 471 <i>et seq</i>. &mdash;
  <b>sicut ... est</b>: 'as we find'; so Off. 1, 32 <i>ut in fabulis
  est</i>, and often. &mdash; <b>in Symposio</b>: 2, 26. &mdash;
  <b>minuta</b>: see <a href="#Snot_52">n. on 52</a>. &mdash;
  <b>rorantia</b>: here with an active sense, 'besprinkling', representing
  <span lang="el"
  title="epipsekazein">&#x3B5;&#x3C0;&#x3B9;&#x3C8;&#x3B5;&#x3BA;&#x3B1;&#x3B6;&#x3B5;&#x3B9;&#x3BD;</span>
  in Xenophon; often however not different in sense from <i>'roscida'</i>.
  &mdash; <b>refrigeratio ... hibernus</b>: cf. closely 57 <i>ubi et
  seq</i>. Note the changes of expression in passing from
  <i>refrigeratio</i> to <i>sol</i> (<i>apricatio</i> would have more
  exactly corresponded with <i>refrigeratio</i>) and from <i>aestate</i> to
  <i>hibernus</i> (for <i>hieme</i>). &mdash; <b>in Sabinis</b>: 'when with
  the Sabines', who were celebrated for their simplicity of life. Cato had
  an estate in the Sabine district. &mdash; <b>convivium vicinorum
  compleo</b>: 'I make up (<i>i.e.</i> to the proper number) a company of
  my neighbors'. &mdash; <b>quod ... producimus</b>: 'and we continue our
  companionship to as late an hour as we can, with changing talk'. The
  phrases <i>multa nocte</i> or <i>de nocte</i> 'late in the night',
  <i>multo die</i> 'late in the day', are common; cf. also Att. 13, 9, 1
  <i>multus sermo ad multum diem</i>; Rep. 6, 10 <i>sermonem in multam
  noctem produximus</i>.</p>

  href="#Sect_21">21</a>, where see <a href="#Snot_21">n.</a> &mdash;
  <b>quasi titillatio</b>: the <i>quasi</i>, as often in Cicero's writings,
  marks a translation from the Greek. Here the Epicurean word
  <span lang="el"
  title="gargalismos">&#x3B3;&#x3B1;&#x3C1;&#x3B3;&#x3B1;&#x3BB;&#x3B9;&#x3C3;&#x3BC;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span>
  is referred to; it is often in Cic. represented by <i>titillatio</i>; cf.
  N.D. 1, 113; Fin. 1, 39; Tusc. 3, 47. &mdash; <b>bene</b>: <i>sc.
  dixit</i>. &mdash; <b>affecto aetate</b>: 'wrought on by age'. Cf. De Or.
  1, 200 <i>in eius infirmissima valetudine affectaque iam aetate.</i>
  &mdash; <b>utereturne</b> etc.: 'whether he still took pleasure in love';
  <i>uti = frui</i>. Cf. Ovid, Met. 4, 259 <i>dementer
  amoribus uti</i> with Cic. Tusc. 4, 68 <i>venereis voluptatibus frui</i>.
  &mdash; <b>di meliora</b>: <i>sc. duint</i>; this archaic form usually
  occurs when the phrase is given in full. The story of Sophocles is taken
  by Cicero from Plato (Rep. 329 B) who has
  <span lang="el"
  title="euphêmei">&#x3B5;&#x3C5;&#x3C6;&#x3B7;&#x3BC;&#x3B5;&#x3B9;</span>. &mdash;
  <b>istinc</b> etc.: cf. the passage in Plato, Rep. 1, 329 C. For
  <i>istinc</i> used otherwise than of place cf. <i>unde</i> in <a
  href="#Sect_12">12</a> with <a href="#Snot_12">n.</a> &mdash;
  <b>agresti</b>: 'boorish'; <i>rusticus</i> denotes simply an ordinary
  countryman. &mdash; <b>quamquam ... ergo</b>: these words may be scanned
  as a hexameter line, but the pause before <i>ergo</i> would prevent them
  from being taken as a verse. &mdash; <b>hoc non desiderare</b>: 'this
  absence of regret'; the words form the subject of <i>est</i>. So <i>hoc
  non dolere</i> in Fin. 2, 18. For the pronoun in agreement with the
  infinitive treated as noun cf. Persius 1, 9 <i>istud vivere</i>; 1, 122
  <i>hoc ridere meum</i>. H. 538, 3.</p>

  <p><b><a name="Snot_48"></a><a href="#Sect_48">48.</a> si</b>: 'even if',
  'granting that'. &mdash; <b>bona aetas</b>: 'the good time of life',
  <i>i.e.</i> youth. Tischer qu. Varro de Re Rustica 2, 6, 2 <i>mares
  feminaeque bona aetate</i> = 'young'. For <i>bona aetas = homines bona
  aetate</i> cf. <a href="#Snot_26">n. on 26</a> <i>senectus</i>. &mdash;
  <b>ut diximus</b>: not expressly, but the opinion is implied in <a
  href="#Sect_44">44</a>, <a href="#Sect_45">45</a>. &mdash; <b>Turpione
  Ambivio</b>: L. Ambivius Turpio was the most famous actor of Cato's time,
  and appeared especially in Terence's plays. In old Latin commonly,
  occasionally in the Latin of the best period, and often in Tacitus, the
  <i>cognomen</i> is placed before the <i>nomen</i> when the
  <i>praenomen</i> is not mentioned. Cf. Att. 11, 12, 1 <i>Balbo
  Cornelio</i>. The usage is more common in Cicero's writings than in those
  of his contemporaries. &mdash; <b>prima cavea</b>: 'the lower tier'. The
  later Roman theatres consisted of semicircular or elliptic galleries,
  with rising tiers of seats; the level space partially enclosed by the
  curve was the <i>orchestra</i>, which was bounded by the stage in front.
  There can be little doubt that Cicero is guilty of an anachronism here;
  his words do not suit the circumstances of Cato's time. Till nearly the
  end of the Republic the theatres were rude structures of wood, put up
  temporarily; it is even doubtful whether they contained seats for the
  audience. Cato himself frustrated an attempt to establish a permanent
  theatre. &mdash; <b>propter</b>: 'close by'. The adverbial use of
  <i>propter</i> (rarely, if ever, met with outside of Cicero) is denied by
  some scholars, but is well attested by MSS. here and elsewhere. &mdash;
  <b>tantum ... est</b>: these words qualify <i>delectatur</i>.</p>

  <p><b><a name="Snot_49"></a><a href="#Sect_49">49.</a> illa</b>: put for
  <i>illud</i>, as in Greek <span lang="el"
  title="tauta">&#x3C4;&#x3B1;&#x3C5;&#x3C4;&#x3B1;</span> and <span
  lang="el" title="tade">&#x3C4;&#x3B1;&#x3B4;&#x3B5;</span> are often put
  for <span lang="el"
  title="touto">&#x3C4;&#x3BF;&#x3C5;&#x3C4;&#x3BF;</span> and <span
  lang="el" title="tode">&#x3C4;&#x3BF;&#x3B4;&#x3B5;</span>. The words from <i>animum</i> to
  the end of the sentence are explanatory of <i>illa</i>. &mdash;
  <b>quanti</b>: 'how valuable!' but the word may have exactly the opposite
  meaning if the context require it; thus in N.D. 1, 55 and Rep. 6, 25 the
  sense is 'how worthless!' &mdash; <b>stipendiis</b>: 'campaigns'. The
  four words from <i>libidinis</i> to <i>inimicitiarum</i> are to be taken
  in pairs, while <i>cupiditatum</i> sums them up and is in apposition to
  all. &mdash; <b>secum esse</b>: cf. Tusc. 1, 75; Pers. 4, 52 <i>tecum
  habita</i>. &mdash; <b>si ... aliquod</b>: the sense is scarcely
  different from that of <i>si ... quod</i>; the distinction is as slight
  as that in English between 'if' followed by 'some', and 'if' followed by
  'any'. Cf. n. on Lael. 24 <i>si quando aliquid</i>. &mdash;
  <b>pabulum</b>: for the metaphorical sense rendered less harsh by
  <i>tamquam</i>, cf. Acad. 2, 127; Tusc. 5, 66 <i>pastus animorum</i>.
  &mdash; <b>studi</b>: an explanatory genitive dependent on
  <i>pabulum</i>. &mdash; <b>otiosa senectute</b>: 'leisured age';
  <i>otium</i> in the Latin of Cicero does not imply idleness, but freedom
  from public business and opportunity for the indulgence of literary and
  scientific tastes. &mdash; <b>videbamus</b>: for the tense cf. Lael. 37
  <i>Gracchum rem publicam vexantem ab amicis derelictum videbamus,
  i.e.</i> 'we saw over a considerable period'. See also 50, 79. &mdash;
  <b>in studio</b> etc.: 'busied with the task of almost measuring bit by
  bit (<i>di-metiendi</i>) the heavens and the earth'. For the sense cf.
  Hor. Od. 1, 28 (of Archytas). &mdash; <b>Gallum</b>: consul in 157 B.C.,
  famous as an astronomer and as the first Roman who predicted an eclipse
  before the battle of Pydna. See Liv. 44, 37.</p>

  <p><b>P. <a href="#Page_21">21</a> &mdash; describere</b>: technically
  used of the drawing of mathematical figures. <i>Ingredior</i> often has
  an infinitive dependent on it even in the best Latin; <i>e.g.</i> Cic.
  Top. 1 <i>nos maiores res scribere ingressos</i>.</p>

  <p><b><a name="Snot_50"></a><a href="#Sect_50">50.</a> acutis</b>:
  requiring keenness of intellect. &mdash; <b>Naevius</b>: see <a
  href="#Snot_20">n. on 20</a>. &mdash; <b>Truculento ... Pseudolo</b>:
  these plays of Plautus (lived from 254 to 184 B.C.) we still possess. The
  Truculentus is so named from one of the characters, a slave of savage
  disposition who is wheedled; the Pseudolus from a cheating slave. The
  latter name is commonly supposed to be a transcription from a Greek word
  <span lang="el"
  title="pseudulos">&#x3C8;&#x3B5;&#x3C5;&#x3B4;&#x3C5;&#x3BB;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span>,
  which however nowhere occurs; and as the change from Greek
  <span
  lang="el" title="u">&#x3C5;</span> to Latin <i>o</i> is not found before <i>l</i>, Corssen
  assumes
  <span lang="el"
  title="pseudalos">&#x3C8;&#x3B5;&#x3C5;&#x3B4;&#x3B1;&#x3BB;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span> as
  the original word. The form <i>Pseudulus</i> of the name is probably
  later than <i>Pseudolus</i>. &mdash; <b>Livium</b>: Livius Andronicus,
  the founder of Latin literature (lived from about 285 to 204 B.C.), who
  translated the Odyssey, also many Greek tragedies. Livius was a Greek
  captured by Livius Salinator at Tarentum in 275 B.C.; for a time he was
  the slave of Livius, and, according to custom, took his name when
  set free. For an account of his writings see Cruttwell's Hist. of Roman
  Literature, Ch. 3; Sellar, Roman Poets of the Rep., Ch. 3. &mdash;
  <b>docuisset</b>: 'had brought on to the stage'. <i>Docere</i> (like

  Greek, which has the same use) meant originally to instruct the
  performers in the play. &mdash; <b>Centone Tuditanoque consulibus</b>:
  <i>i.e.</i> in 240 B.C. The use of <i>que</i> here is noticeable; when a
  date is given by reference to the consuls of the year it is usual to
  insert <i>et</i> (not <i>que</i> or <i>atque</i>, which rarely occur)
  between the two names, if only the <i>cognomina</i> (as here) be given.
  If the full names be given, then they are put side by side without
  <i>et</i>. Cf. <a href="#Snot_10">n. on 10</a>. &mdash; <b>Crassi</b>:
  see <a href="#Snot_27">n. on 27</a>. &mdash; <b>pontifici et civilis
  iuris</b>: the <i>ius pontificium</i> regarded mainly the proper modes of
  conducting religious ceremonial. <i>Ius civile</i>, which is often used
  to denote the whole body of Roman Law, here includes only the secular
  portion of that Law. Cf. <a href="#Snot_38">n. on 38</a>. &mdash;
  <b>huius P. Scipionis</b>: 'the present P. Scipio'. So in <a
  href="#Sect_14">14</a> <i>hi consules</i> 'the present consuls'; Rep. 1,
  14 <i>Africanus hic, Pauli filius</i>, and often. The P. Scipio who is
  meant here is not Africanus, but Nasica Corculum. &mdash;
  <b>flagrantis</b>: 'all aglow'; so <i>ardere studio</i> in Acad. 2, 65.
  &mdash; <b>senes</b>: = <i>cum senes essent</i>, so <i>senem</i> below.
  &mdash; <b>suadae medullam</b>: 'the essence (lit. marrow) of

  summary of the preceding arguments, preparatory to a transition to a new
  subject, introduced by <i>venio nunc ad</i>. The succession of two

  5, 80 and elsewhere. &mdash; <b>honestum sit</b>: 'does him honor'.

  27</a>) says that Cicero's rule is to say <i>potest esse, debet esse</i>
  and the like, not <i>esse potest</i> and the like. It is true that
  <i>esse</i> in such cases is very seldom separated from the word on which
  it depends, but <i>esse potest</i> is just as common as <i>potest
  esse</i>; the difference to the sense is one of emphasis only, the
  <i>esse</i> having more emphasis thrown on it in the latter case.</p>

  <p><b><a name="Snot_51"></a><a href="#Sect_51">51.</a> mihi ...
  videntur</b>: see Introd. &mdash; <b>habent rationem cum</b>: 'they have
  their reckonings with', 'their dealings with'; a phrase of book-keeping.
  &mdash; <b>imperium</b>: so Verg. Georg. 1, 99 <i>exercetque frequens
  tellurem atque imperat agris</i>; ib. 2, 369 <i>dura exerce imperia et
  ramos compesce fluentes</i>; Tac. Germ. 26 <i>sola terrae seges
  imperatur</i>. &mdash; <b>sed alias ... faenore</b>: put for <i>sed
  semper cum faenore, alias minore, plerumque maiore</i>. &mdash; <b>vis ac
  natura</b>: 'powers and constitution'. These two words are very often
  used by Cic. together, as in Fin. 1, 50 <i>vis ac natura rerum</i>.
  &mdash; <b>gremio</b>: so Lucret. 1, 250 <i>pereunt imbres ubi eos pater
  aether In gremium matris terrai praecipitavit</i>, imitated by Verg.
  Georg. 2, 325. &mdash; <b>mollito ac subacto</b>: <i>i.e.</i> by the
  plough. <i>Subigere</i>, 'subdue', is a technical word of agriculture; so
  Verg. Georg. 2, 50 <i>scrobibus subactis</i>; see also below, <a
  href="#Sect_59">59</a>.</p>

  <p><b>P. <a href="#Page_22">22</a> &mdash; occaecatum</b>: 'hidden'.
  <i>Caecus</i> has the sense of 'unseen' as well as that of 'unseeing' or
  'blind'. &mdash; <b>occatio</b>: Cicero's derivation, as well as Varro's
  (De Re Rust. 1, 31, 1) from <i>occidere</i>, because the earth is cut up,
  is unsound. <i>Occa</i> is <i>rastrum</i>, probably from its <i>sharp</i>
  points (root <i>ak-</i>); <i>occatio</i> therefore is 'harrowing'.
  &mdash; <b>vapore</b>: 'heat'. This word has not in the best Latin the
  meaning of our 'vapor'. &mdash; <b>compressu</b>: a word found only here
  in Cicero's writings and elsewhere in Latin only in the ablative case,
  like so many other nouns whose stem ends in <i>-u</i>. &mdash;
  <b>diffundit et elicit</b>: 'expands and lures forth'. &mdash;
  <b>herbescentem</b>: this word occurs nowhere else in Latin. &mdash;
  <b>nixa</b>: A. 254, <i>b</i>; G. 403, Rem. 3; H. 425, 1, 1), n. &mdash;
  <b>fibris stirpium</b>: so Tusc. 3, 13 <i>radicum fibras</i>. &mdash;
  <b>geniculato</b>: 'knotted'. The verb <i>geniculo</i>, from <i>genu</i>,
  scarcely occurs excepting in the passive participle, which is always
  used, as here, of plants. So Plin. Nat. Hist. 16, 158 <i>geniculata
  cetera gracilitas nodisque distincta</i>, speaking of the <i>harundo</i>.
  &mdash; <b>spici</b>: besides <i>spica</i>, the forms <i>spicum</i> and
  <i>spicus</i> are occasionally found. <i>Spici</i> here is explanatory
  <i>frugem</i>. &mdash; <b>vallo</b>: for the metaphor compare N.D. 2, 143
  <i>munitae sunt palpebrae tamquam vallo pilorum</i>; Lucr. 2, 537.</p>

  <p><b><a name="Snot_52"></a><a href="#Sect_52">52.</a> quid ego ...
  commemorem</b>: this and similar formulae for passing to a new subject
  are common; cf. <a href="#Sect_53">53</a> <i>quid ego ... proferam</i>
  etc.; often <i>nam</i> precedes the <i>quid</i>, as in Lael. 104. The
  <i>ego</i> has a slight emphasis. Cato implies that his own devotion to
  grape-culture was so well known as not to need description. &mdash;
  <b>ortus satus incrementa</b>: 'origin, cultivation, and growth'. For the
  omission of the copula see <a href="#Snot_53">n. on 53</a>. &mdash;
  <b>ut</b>: final, and slightly elliptic ('I say this that etc.'); so in
  <a href="#Sect_6">6</a> (where see <a href="#Snot_82">n.</a>), <a
  href="#Sect_24">24</a>, <a href="#Sect_56">56</a>, <a
  href="#Sect_59">59</a>, <a href="#Sect_82">82</a>. &mdash;
  <b>requietem</b>: the best MSS. of Cic. sometimes give the other form
  <i>requiem</i>, as in Arch. 13. &mdash; <b>vim ipsam</b>: 'the inherent
  energy'. &mdash; <b>omnium ... terra</b>: a common periphrasis for 'all
  plants'; cf. <i>e.g.</i> N.D. 2, 120. The Latin has no one word to
  comprehend all vegetable products. &mdash; <b>quae ... procreet</b>:
  'able to generate'. &mdash; <b>tantulo</b>: strictly elliptic, implying
  <i>quantulum re vera est</i>. In such uses <i>tantus</i> and
  <i>tantulus</i> differ slightly from <i>magnus</i> and <i>parvus</i>;
  they are more emphatic. &mdash; <b>acini vinaceo</b>: 'a grape-stone'.
  &mdash; <b>minutissimis</b>: used here for <i>minimis</i>. Strictly
  speaking <i>minutus</i> ought to be used of things which are fragments of
  larger things, <i>minutus</i> being really the participle passive of
  <i>minuo</i>. In a well-known passage (Orat. 94) Cic. himself calls
  attention to the theoretical incorrectness of the use, which, however, is
  found throughout Latin literature. Cf. <a href="#Sect_46">46</a>
  <i>pocula minuta</i>; also below, <a href="#Sect_85">85</a> <i>minuti
  philosophi</i>. &mdash; <b>malleoli</b>: vine-cuttings; so called because
  a portion of the parent stem was cut away with the new shoot, leaving the
  cutting in the shape of a mallet. &mdash; <b>plantae</b>: 'suckers',
  shoots springing out of the trunk. &mdash; <b>sarmenta</b>: 'scions',
  shoots cut from branches not from the trunk. &mdash; <b>viviradices</b>:
  'quicksets', new plants formed by dividing the roots of the mother plant.
  &mdash; <b>propagines</b>: 'layers', new plants formed by rooting a shoot
  in the earth without severing it from the parent plant; Verg. Georg. 2,
  26. &mdash; <b>eadem</b>: <a href="#Snot_4">n. on 4</a> <i>eandem</i>.
  &mdash; <b>claviculis</b>: cf. N.D. 2, 120 <i>vites sic claviculis</i>.
  &mdash; <b>ars agricolarum</b>: <i>agricolae arte freti</i>, a strong
  instance of the abstract put for the concrete.</p>

  <p><b><a name="Snot_53"></a><a href="#Sect_53">53.</a> eis</b>: <i>sc.
  sarmentis</i>, those which have not been pruned away by the knife.
  &mdash; <b>exsistit</b>: 'springs up'. <i>Exsistere</i> in good Latin
  never has the meaning of our 'exist', <i>i.e.</i> '<i>to be in</i>
  existence', but always means '<i>to come into</i> existence'. &mdash;
  <b>articulos</b>: 'joints'; cf. 51 <i>culmo geniculato</i>. The word
  <i>tamquam</i> softens the metaphor in <i>articuli</i>, which would
  properly be used only of the joints in the limbs of animals. &mdash;
  <b>gemma</b>: Cicero took the meaning 'gem' or 'jewel' to be the primary
  sense of <i>gemma</i> and considered that the application to a bud was
  metaphorical. See the well-known passages, Orat. 81 and De Or. 3, 155.
  &mdash; <b>vestita pampinis</b>: 'arrayed in the young foliage'. &mdash;
  <b>fructu ... aspectu</b>: ablatives of respect, like <i>gustatu</i>
  above. &mdash; <b>capitum iugatio</b>: 'the linking together of their
  tops'; <i>i.e.</i> the uniting of the tops of the stakes by cross-stakes.
  So the editors; but Conington on Verg. Georg. 2, 355 seems to take
  <i>capita</i> of the top-foliage of the vines, an
  interpetation which is quite possible. Those editors are certainly wrong
  who remove the comma after <i>iugatio</i> and place it after
  <i>religatio</i>, as though <i>et</i> were omitted between the two words.
  In enumerations of more than two things Cic. either omits the copula
  altogether or inserts it before each word after the first; but in
  enumerating two things <i>et</i> cannot be omitted, except where there
  are several <i>sets</i> or <i>pairs</i> of things. Cf. <a
  href="#Snot_13">n. on 13</a>. &mdash; <b>religatio</b>: <i>i.e.</i> the
  tying down of shoots so as to cause them to take root in the earth.
  <i>Religatio</i> seems to occur only here.</p>

  <p><b>P. <a href="#Page_23">23</a> &mdash; aliorum immissio</b>: 'the
  granting of free scope to others'. <i>Immissio</i> scarcely occurs
  elsewhere in good Latin. The metaphor is from letting loose the reins in
  driving; cf. Verg. Georg. 2, 364; Plin. N.H. 16, 141 <i>cupressus
  immittitur in perticas asseresque amputatione ramorum</i>; Varro, R.R. 1,
  31, 1 <i>vitis immittitur ad uvas pariendas</i>. Some, referring to
  Columella de Arbor, c. 7, take the word to mean the setting in the earth
  of a shoot in order that it may take root before being separated from the
  parent stem. The context, however, is against this interpretation.
  &mdash; <b>irrigationes</b> etc.: the plurals denote more prominently
  than singulars would the repetition of the actions expressed by these
  words. &mdash; <b>repastinationes</b>: 'repeated hoeings'. The
  <i>pastinum</i> was a kind of pitchfork, used for turning over the ground
  round about the vines, particularly when the young plants were being put
  in. &mdash; <b>multo terra fecundior</b>: see <a href="#Snot_3">n. on
  3</a> <i>parum ... auctoritatis</i>.</p>

  <p><b><a name="Snot_54"></a><a href="#Sect_54">54.</a> in eo libro</b>:
  see Introd. &mdash; <b>doctus</b>: often used of poets, not only by
  Cicero but by most other Latin writers, more particularly by the elegiac
  poets; see also <a href="#Snot_13">n. on 13</a>. &mdash; <b>Hesiodus</b>:
  the oldest Greek poet after Homer. The poem referred to here is the
  <span lang="el" title="Erga kai Hêmerai">&#x395;&#x3C1;&#x3B3;&#x3B1; &#x3BA;&#x3B1;&#x3B9;
  &#x201B;&#x397;&#x3BC;&#x3B5;&#x3C1;&#x3B1;&#x3B9;</span> which we still possess, along
  with the Theogony and the Shield of Heracles. &mdash; <b>cum</b>:
  concessive. &mdash; <b>saeculis</b>: 'generations', as in <a
  href="#Sect_24">24</a>. &mdash; <b>fuit</b>: = <i>vixit</i>. &mdash;
  <b>Laerten</b>: the passage referred to is no doubt the touching scene in
  Odyss. 24, 226, where Odysseus, after killing the suitors, finds his
  unhappy old father toiling in his garden. In that passage nothing is said
  of <i>manuring</i>. &mdash; <b>lenientem</b>: see <a href="#Snot_11">n.
  on 11</a> <i>dividenti</i>. &mdash; <b>colentem</b> etc.: the
  introduction of another participle to explain <i>lenientem</i> is far
  from elegant. <i>Cultione agri</i> or something of the kind might have
  been expected. The collocation of <i>appetentem</i> with <i>occupatum</i>
  in 56 is no less awkward. &mdash; <b>facit</b>: <a href="#Snot_3">n. on
  3</a> <i>facimus</i>. &mdash; <b>res rusticae laetae sunt</b>: 'the
  farmer's life is gladdened'. &mdash; <b>apium</b>: this form is oftener
  found in the best MSS., of prose writers at least, than the
  other form <i>apum</i>, which probably was not used by Cic. &mdash;
  <b>omnium</b>: = <i>omnis generis</i>. &mdash; <b>consitiones ...
  insitiones</b>: 'planting ... grafting'. On the varieties of grafting and
  the skill required for it see Verg. Georg. 2, 73 <i>seq.</i></p>

  <p><b><a name="Snot_55"></a><a href="#Sect_55">55.</a> possum</b>: see <a
  href="#Snot_24">n. on 24</a>. &mdash; <b>ignoscetis</b>: 'you will excuse
  (me)'. &mdash; <b>provectus sum</b>: 'I have been carried away'. Cicero
  often uses <i>prolabi</i> in the same sense. &mdash; <b>in hac ...
  consumpsit</b>: Cic. probably never, as later writers did, used
  <i>consumere</i> with a simple ablative. &mdash; <b>Curius</b>: see <a
  href="#Snot_15">n. on 15</a>. &mdash; <b>a me</b>: = <i>a mea villa;</i>
  cf. <a href="#Snot_3">n. on 3</a> <i>apud quem</i>. &mdash; <b>admirari
  satis non possum</b>: a favorite form of expression with Cicero;
  <i>e.g.</i> De Or. 1, 165. &mdash; <b>disciplinam</b>: 'morals';
  literally 'teaching'.</p>

  <p><b><a name="Snot_56"></a><a href="#Sect_56">56.</a> Curio</b>:
  Plutarch, Cat. 2, says the ambassadors found him cooking a dinner of
  herbs, and that Curius sent them away with the remark that a man who
  dined in that way had no need of gold. The present was not brought as a
  bribe, since the incident took place after the war. Curius had become
  <i>patronus</i> of the Samnites, and they were bringing the customary
  offering of <i>clientes</i>; see Rep. 3, 40. &mdash; <b>ne</b>: here =
  num, a rare use; so Fin. 3, 44; Acad. 2, 116. &mdash; <b>sed venio
  ad</b>: so in <a href="#Sect_51">51</a> <i>venio nunc ad. Redeo ad</i>
  (see <a href="#Snot_32">n. on 32</a>) might have been expected here.
  &mdash; <b>in agris erant</b>: 'lived on their farms'. For <i>erant</i>
  cf. <a href="#Snot_21">n. on 21</a> <i>sunt</i>. &mdash; <b>id est
  senes</b>: cf. <a href="#Sect_19">19</a> <a href="#Snot_19">n.</a> on
  <i>senatum</i>. &mdash; <b>si quidem</b>: often written as one word
  <i>siquidem</i> = <span
  lang="el" title="eiper">&#x3B5;&#x3B9;&#x3C0;&#x3B5;&#x3C1;</span>. &mdash;
  <b>aranti</b>: emphatic position. &mdash; <b>Cincinnato</b>: L. Quinctius
  Cincinnatus is said to have been dictator twice; in 458 B.C., when he
  saved the Roman army, which was surrounded by the Aequians, and ended the
  war in sixteen days from his appointment; in 439, when Maelius was killed
  and Cincinnatus was eighty years old. In our passage Cic. seems to assume
  only one dictatorship. The story of Cincinnatus at the plough is told in
  Livy 3, 26. &mdash; <b>factum</b>: the technical term was <i>dicere
  dictatorem</i>, since he was nominated by the consul on the advice of the
  senate. &mdash; <b>dictatoris</b>: in apposition with <i>cuius</i>.</p>

  <p><b>P. <a href="#Page_24">24</a> &mdash; Maelium</b>: a rich plebeian,
  who distributed corn in time of famine and was charged with courting the
  people in order to make himself a king. Ahala summoned him before the
  dictator, and because he did not immediately obey, killed him with his
  own hand. For this, Ahala became one of the heroes of his nation. See
  Liv. 4, 13. Cicero often mentions him with praise. Cf. in Catil. I. 3; p.
  Sestio 143, etc. &mdash; <b>appetentem</b>: = <i>quia
  appetebat</i>; so <i>occupatum</i> = <i>cum occupasset</i>. &mdash;
  <b>viatores</b>: literally 'travellers', so 'messengers'. They formed a
  regularly organized corporation at Rome and were in attendance on many of
  the magistrates. Those officers who had the <i>fasces</i> had also
  lictors, who, however, generally remained in close attendance and were
  not despatched on distant errands. The statement of Cic. in the text is
  repeated almost <i>verbatim</i> by Plin. N.H. 18, 21. &mdash;
  <b>miserabilis</b>: 'to be pitied'. The word does not quite answer to our
  'miserable'. &mdash; <b>agri cultione</b>: a rare expression, found
  elsewhere only in Verr. 3, 226; then not again till the 'Fathers'.
  &mdash; <b>haud scio an nulla</b>: since <i>haud scio an</i> is
  affirmative in Cicero, not negative as in some later writers,
  <i>nulla</i> must be read here, not <i>ulla</i>. Cf. 73 <i>haud scio an
  melius Ennius</i>, 'probably Ennius speaks better'; also <a
  href="#Sect_74">74</a> <i>incertium an hoc ipso die</i>, 'possibly
  to-day'. Roby, 2256; G. 459, Rem.; H. 529, II. 3, 20, n. 2. &mdash;
  <b>quam dixi</b>: = <i>de qua dixi</i>, as in <a href="#Sect_53">53</a>.
  &mdash; <b>saturitate</b>: the word is said to occur nowhere else in
  Latin. &mdash; <b>quidam</b>: <i>i.e.</i> the authors of the <i>tertia
  vituperatio senectutis</i>, whom Cato refutes in <a
  href="#Sect_39">39</a>, <a href="#Sect_59">59</a>. &mdash; <b>porco ...
  gallina</b>: these words are used collectively, as <i>rosa</i> often is;
  so Fin. 2, 65 <i>potantem in rosa Thorium</i>. &mdash; <b>iam</b>:
  'further'. &mdash; <b>succidiam alteram</b>: 'a second meat-supply'. The
  word seems to be connected with <i>caedo</i>, and probably originally
  meant 'slaughter'. In a fragment of Cato preserved by Gellius 13, 24, 12
  (in some editions 13, 25, 12) we find <i>succidias humanas facere</i>.
  Varro, R.R. 2, 14 has the word in the sense of 'meat'. &mdash;
  <b>conditiora facit</b>: 'adds a zest to'; cf. <i>condita</i> in <a
  href="#Sect_10">10</a>. &mdash; <b>supervacaneis operis</b>: 'by the use
  of spare time'; literally 'by means of toils that are left over',
  <i>i.e.</i> after completing the ordinary work of the farm.</p>

  <p><b><a name="Snot_57"></a><a href="#Sect_57">57.</a> ordinibus</b>: cf.
  <a href="#Sect_59">59</a> <i>ordines</i>. &mdash; <b>brevi praecidam</b>:
  'I will cut the matter short', for <i>praecidam</i> (<i>sc. rem</i> or
  <i>sermonem</i>) cf. Acad. 2, 133 <i>praecide</i> (<i>sc. sermonem</i>);
  for <i>brevi</i> (= 'in brief', <span lang="el" title="en brachei">&#x3B5;&#x3BD;
  &#x3B2;&#x3C1;&#x3B1;&#x3C7;&#x3B5;&#x3B9;</span>) cf. De Or. 1, 34 <i>ne plura
  consecter comprehendam brevi</i>. &mdash; <b>usu uberius</b>: cf. 53
  <i>fructu laetius ... aspectu pulchrius</i>. &mdash; <b>ad quem ...
  retardat</b>: some have thought that there is zeugma here, supposing
  <i>ad</i> to be suited only to <i>invitat</i>, not to <i>retardat</i>.
  That this is not the case is clear from such passages as Caes. B.G. 7,
  26, 2 <i>palus Romanos ad insequendum tardabat</i> (= <i>tardos
  faciebat</i>); Cic. Sull. 49 <i>nullius amicitia ad pericula propulsanda
  impedimur</i>. On <i>fruendum</i> see Madvig, 421, <i>a</i>, Obs. 2 and
  265, Obs. 2; G. 428, Rem. 3, exc.; H. 544, 2, n. 5. &mdash;
  <b>invitat atque allectat</b>: one of the 'doublets' of which Cicero is
  so fond; cf. Lael. 99 <i>allectant et invitant</i>.</p>

  <p><b><a name="Snot_58"></a><a href="#Sect_58">58.</a> sibi habeant</b>:
  <i>sc. iuvenes</i>; contemptuous, as in Lael. 18 <i>sibi habeant
  sapientiae nomen</i> Sull. 26 <i>sibi haberent honores, sibi imperia</i>
  etc.; cf. the formula of Roman divorce, <i>tu tuas res tibi habeto</i>.
  &mdash; <b>hastas</b>: in practising, the point was covered by a button,
  <i>pila</i>; cf. Liv. 26, 51 <i>praepilatis missilibus iaculati sunt</i>.
  &mdash; <b>clavam</b>: cf. Vegetius de Re Mil. 1, 11 <i>clavas ligneas
  pro gladiis tironibus dabant, eoque modo exercebantur ad palos</i>; Iuv.
  6, 246. The <i>palus</i> is called <i>stipes</i> by Martial 7, 32.
  &mdash; <b>pilam ... venationes ... cursus</b>: all national amusements,
  well known to readers of Horace; see Becker's Gallus. <i>Venationes</i>,
  em. for <i>nataliones</i>. &mdash; <b>talos ... tesseras</b>:
  <i>tali</i>, 'knucklebones', were oblong, and rounded at the two ends;
  the sides were numbered 1 and 6 (1 being opposite to 6), 3 and 4. Four
  <i>tali</i> were used at a time and they, like the <i>tesserae</i>, were
  generally thrown from a box, <i>fritillus</i>. The <i>tesserae</i>, of
  which three were used at a time, were cubes, with the sides numbered from
  1 to 6 in such a way that the numbers on two opposite sides taken
  together always made 7. A separate name was used by dicers for almost
  every possible throw of the <i>tesserae</i> and <i>tali</i>. The two best
  known are <i>canis</i>, when all the dice turned up with the same number
  uppermost; and <i>venus</i>, when they all showed different numbers. The
  word <i>alea</i> was general and applicable to games of chance of every
  kind. These games, which were forbidden by many ineffectual laws
  ('<i>vetita legibus alea</i>') were held to be permissible for old men;
  see Mayor on Iuv. 14, 4. &mdash; <b>id ipsum</b>: sc. <i>faciunt</i>; the
  omission of <i>facere</i> is not uncommon. Roby, 1441; H. 368, 3, n. 1.
  &mdash; <b>ut</b>: em. for ordinary readings <i>unum</i> and
  <i>utrum</i>.</p>

  <p><b><a name="Snot_59"></a><a href="#Sect_59">59.</a> legite</b>:
  'continue to read'. Cf. De Or. 1, 34 <i>pergite, ut facitis,
  adulescentes</i>. In Tusc. 2, 62 it is stated that Africanus was a great
  reader of Xenophon.</p>

  <p><b>P. <a href="#Page_25">25</a> &mdash; libro qui est de</b>: so in
  Fat. 1 <i>libris qui sunt de natura deorum,</i> and similarly elsewhere;
  but the periphrasis is often avoided, as in Off. 2, 16 <i>Dicaearchi
  liber de interitu hominum</i>. &mdash; <b>qui</b>: <i>quique</i> might
  have been expected, but the words above, <i>qui ... familiari,</i> are
  regarded as parenthetical. &mdash; <b>Oeconomicus</b>: Cicero translates
  from this work c. 4, 20-25. &mdash; <b>inscribitur</b>: see <a
  href="#Snot_13">n. on 13</a>. &mdash; <b>regale</b>: 'worthy of a king';
  different from <i>regium</i>, which would mean 'actually characteristic
  of kings'. Yet Cic. sometimes interchanges the words; thus <i>regalis
  potestas</i> in Har. Resp. 54 is the same as
  <i>regia potestas</i> in Phil. 1, 3. &mdash; <b>loquitur cum Critobulo</b> etc.:
  'discourses with Critobulus of how Cyrus etc.'. The construction of
  <i>loqui</i> with acc. and inf. belongs to colloquial Latin, as does the
  construction <i>loqui aliquam rem</i> for <i>de aliqua re</i>; cf. Att.
  1, 5, 6 <i>mecum Tadius locutus est te ita scripsisse</i>; ib. 9, 13, 1
  <i>mera scelera loquuntur</i>. &mdash; <b>Cyrum minorem</b>: Cyrus the
  younger (cf. <a href="#Sect_79">79</a> <i>Cyrus maior</i>), well known
  from Xenophon's <i>Anabasis</i>. As Cyrus never arrived at the throne
  (having been killed at Cunaxa in 401 in his attempt to oust his brother
  the king with the help of the 10,000 Greeks) <i>regem</i> is used in the
  sense of 'prince', as in Verr. 4, 61 and elsewhere;
  <span lang="el"
  title="basileus">&#x3B2;&#x3B1;&#x3C3;&#x3B9;&#x3BB;&#x3B5;&#x3C5;&#x3C2;</span> is
  used in exactly the same way in a passage of the Oeconomicus which comes
  a little before the one Cic. is here rendering (4, 16). &mdash;
  <b>Lysander</b>: the great commander who in 405 B.C. won the battle of
  Aegospotamos against the Athenians. &mdash; <b>Sardis</b>: acc. pl.;
  <i>-is</i> represents Gk. <span lang="el"

  this will account for the omission of <i>et</i> before <i>diligenter
  consitum</i>. &mdash; <b>diligenter</b>: 'carefully'. &mdash;
  <b>proceritates</b>: the plural probably indicates the height of each
  <i>kind</i> of tree. &mdash; <b>quincuncem</b>: thus
  <span class="fx">:·:·:·:·:·:·:</span> This
  was the order of battle in the Roman army during a great part of its
  history. The cause for this application of the term is rather difficult
  to see; it originally meant five-twelfths of an <i>uncia</i>; possibly it
  was thus applied because by drawing lines between the points the letter V
  (five) might be produced. As regards its application to trees, see Verg.
  Georg. 2, 277-284. &mdash; <b>puram</b>: so the farmers talk of
  'cleaning' the land. &mdash; <b>dimensa</b>: notice the passive use of
  this participle, originally deponent; cf. <a href="#Snot_4">n. on 4</a>
  <i>adeptam</i>. &mdash; <b>discripta</b>: 'arranged'; so
  <i>discriptio</i> a little farther on. Cf. <a href="#Snot_5">n. on 5</a>
  <i>descriptae</i>. &mdash; <b>ornatum</b>: 'costume', used by Latin
  writers of any dress a little unfamiliar. So in Plaut. Miles 4, 4, 41
  (1177 R) <i>ornatus nauclericus</i>.</p>

  <p><b><a name="Snot_60"></a><a href="#Sect_60">60.</a> impedit</b>:
  <i>sc. nos</i>; with this construction the pronoun is always omitted.
  &mdash; <b>Valerium</b>: when a young man, in 349 B.C., he engaged in
  combat with a Gaul, in sight of the Roman and Gallic armies, and came off
  victor by the aid of a raven, <i>corvus</i>; hence the name Corvinus
  (Liv. 7, 26). His first consulship was in 348, his last in 299; Cic. has
  miscalculated. Valerius was also twice dictator and is said to have held
  altogether 21 terms of curule offices. &mdash; <b>perduxisse</b>: <i>sc.
  agri colendi studia</i>. Cf. Lael. 33 <i>quod &mdash; perduxissent</i>.
  &mdash; <b>esset</b>: cf. <a href="#Snot_21">n. on 21</a>.
  &mdash; <b>aetate</b>: here = the vigorous period of life; cf. <i>bona
  aetas</i> in <a href="#Sect_48">48</a>. &mdash; <b>cursus honorum</b>:
  'official career'. &mdash; <b>huius</b>: <i>ille</i> and <i>hic</i> are
  not often found in the same sentence referring to the same person.
  <i>Eius</i> would have been more regular here. &mdash; <b>media</b>: cf.
  <a href="#Snot_33">n. on 33</a> <i>constantis aetatis</i>.</p>

  <p><b>P. <a href="#Page_26">26</a> &mdash; apex</b>: 'the crown', 'the
  highest glory'. The word meant originally 'knot', being connected with
  <i>ap-tus ap-isci ap-ere</i> and other words containing the idea of
  binding fast or grasping. It was properly applied to the olive-twig bound
  round with wool, which was stuck in the cap worn by the <i>flamines</i>
  and <i>salii</i>. It is sometimes employed to translate
  <span lang="el"

  <i>regum apices</i>, with which cf. Odes, 1, 34, 14. The word is scarcely
  found elsewhere in a metaphorical sense. Our passage is imitated by
  Ammianus Marcellinus (a great imitator of Cicero) 27, 7, 2 <i>Rufinus
  velut apicem honoratae senectutis praetendens</i>.</p>

  <p><b><a name="Snot_61"></a><a href="#Sect_61">61.</a> Metello</b>: see
  <a href="#Snot_30">n. on 30</a>. &mdash; <b>A. Atilio Calatino</b>:
  consul in 258 B.C. and again in 254; dictator in 249, censor in 247.
  Cicero classed him with old heroes like Curius and Fabricius (Planc. 60).
  His tomb was on the <i>via Appia</i> outside the <i>Porta Capena</i>,
  close to the well-known tomb of the Scipios (see Tusc. 1, 13). &mdash;
  <b>in quem ... elogium</b>: 'in whose honor there is the inscription'.
  With <i>in quem = de quo</i> cf. the occasional occurrence of
  <span lang="el" title="kata tinos">&#x3BA;&#x3B1;&#x3C4;&#x3B1;

  929, <i>d</i>. &mdash; <b>hunc</b> etc.: the inscription (which is quoted
  by Cicero also in Fin. 2, 116) is strikingly like that on the tomb of
  <i>Scipio Barbatus</i> which has actually come down to us, and thus
  begins (Ritschl's recension):</p>

  <div class="noflo">
    <div class="nofblk">
      <p><i>honc oino ploirime cosentiont Romai</i></p>
      <p><i>duonoro optumo fuise viro viroro</i></p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p><i>i.e. hunc unum plurimi consentiunt Romae bonorum optimum fuisse
  virum virorum</i>. Ritschl thus completes the <i>elogium</i> of Atilus,
  by comparison with others still preserved: <i>dictator</i> (ending the
  second line), <i>Consul, censor, aedilis hic fuit apud vos</i>. But
  Cicero's words (<i>nolum ... sepulcro</i>) seem to imply a longer
  inscription than one of three lines; the analogy of the Scipionic
  inscriptions points the same way. The older monumental inscriptions of
  Rome were written in the Saturnian metre, which depended
  partly on accent. The normal line ran thus:</p>

	<div class="center">
	<img src="images/136.png" alt="Saturnian" />
	</div>

  <p>but there were many deviations. &mdash; <b>unum</b>: intensifies
  <i>primarium</i>, 'the very first'; cf. the common use of <i>unus</i>
  with a superlative adjective, for which see n. on Lael. 1 <i>unum</i>
  etc. &mdash; <b>esset consentiens</b>: cf. <a href="#Snot_26">n. on
  26</a> <i>agens aliquid</i>. &mdash; <b>nuper</b>: like <i>modo</i> (see
  <a href="#Snot_27">n. on 27</a>) <i>nuper</i> is loosely used, and has
  its meaning defined by the context. Cf. n. on Lael. 13. In Plin. Ep. 1,
  2, 2 the orator Calvus, a younger contemporary of Cicero, is said to have
  existed <i>nuper</i>. &mdash; <b>Lepidum</b>: <i>pontifex maximus</i>
  from 180 B.C., consul in 187 and in 175; censor in 179; he is said to
  have been chosen <i>princeps senatus</i> by six sets of censors in
  succession. He died in 152. &mdash; <b>Paulo</b>: see <a

  &mdash; <b>Maximo</b>: see <a href="#Sect_10">10</a> <i>et seq</i>.
  &mdash; <b>sententia</b>: <i>i.e.</i> a set speech in the senate. Cf. De
  Or. 1, 38 <i>is non accurata orationis copia, sed nutu atque verbo
  libertinos in urbanas tribus transtulit</i>. &mdash; <b>honorata</b>: see
  <a href="#Snot_22">n. on 22</a>.</p>

  <p><b><a name="Snot_62"></a><a href="#Sect_62">62.</a> in omni
  oratione</b>: 'everywhere throughout my speech'. <i>Tota oratione</i>
  would have meant 'my speech viewed as a whole'. &mdash;
  <b>defenderet</b>: the tense is accommodated to that of <i>dixi</i>,
  according to Latin custom; see <a href="#Snot_42">n. on 42</a>
  <i>efficeret</i>. &mdash; <b>cani</b>: <i>sc. capilli</i>; the same
  ellipsis is found in Ovid. Cf. <i>calda (sc. aqua), laurea (sc. corona),
  natalis (sc. dies), Latinae (sc. feriae)</i>, etc.; also <i>cereo</i> in
  <a href="#Sect_44">44</a>. &mdash; <b>fructus ... extremos</b>: 'receives
  the reward of influence at the last'.</p>

  <p><b><a name="Snot_63"></a><a href="#Sect_63">63.</a> appeti</b>: 'to be
  courted'; <i>decedi</i>: 'to take precedence', literally 'that there
  should be a yielding of the way'. &mdash; <b>assurgi</b>: 'the honor
  shown by rising'. Cf. Iuv. 13, 54 <i>credebant grande nefas et morte
  piandum si iuvenis vetulo non assurrexerat</i>, where see Mayor's note.
  &mdash; <b>deduci reduci</b>: 'the escort from home and the attendance
  homeward'. The difference between these two words, which has often been
  misunderstood, is shown by Val. Max. 2, 1, 9 <i>iuvenes senatus die
  utique aliquem ex patribus conscriptis ad curiam deducebant, affixique
  valvis exspectabant donec reducendi etiam officio fungerentur</i>.
  &mdash; <b>consuli</b>: probably refers to private legal consultations as
  well as to the deliberations of the senate. &mdash; <b>ut quaeque
  optime</b>: Cic. often uses <i>ut quisque</i> with superlatives,
  <i>ita</i> following; see n. on Lael. 19. Translate <i>ut ... ita</i> 'in
  proportion as ... so'. &mdash; <b>morata</b>: from <i>mos</i>. &mdash;
  <b>modo</b>: in <a href="#Sect_59">59</a>. &mdash; <b>memoriae proditum
  est</b>: in Verr. 5, 36 Cic. uses <i>ad memoriam</i> instead of the
  dative. The best writers have <i>memoriae prodere</i> and
  <i>prodi</i>, '<i>for the recollection of</i> posterity', <i>memoria
  prodi</i>, 'to be handed down <i>by</i> tradition'; but not <i>memoria
  prodere</i>. &mdash; <b>ludis</b>: <i>sc. Panathenaicis</i>, abl. of
  time. The Panathenaea was the greatest of the Athenian festivals and was
  celebrated in honor of Athene, patron goddess of the city, once in four
  years. The story that follows is told in almost the same words by Val.
  Max. 4, 5, ext. 2.</p>

  <p><b>P. <a href="#Page_27">27</a> &mdash; qui</b>: at this point the

  <b>legati cum essent</b>: 'being ambassadors'. &mdash; <b>illi</b>: 'in
  his honor'. &mdash; <b>sessum recepisse</b>: Val. Max. uses the same
  phrase; cf. Fam. 10, 32, 2 <i>sessum deducere</i>; N.D. 3, 74 <i>sessum

  <i>diritas</i> are rare in Cicero; the former word does not once occur in

  that old man'. Cicero oftener joins <i>O</i> with the accusative than
  with the nominative: he rarely, if ever, uses the interjection with the
  vocative in direct address to persons. &mdash; <b>extinguit animum</b>:
  the doctrine of the annihilation of the soul after death was held by many
  of Cicero's contemporaries, professedly by the Epicureans (<i>e.g.</i>
  Lucretius, De Rerum Nat. 3, 417 <i>et seq.</i>; cf. also Caesar's
  argument at the trial of the Catilinian conspirators, Sall. Bell. Catil.
  c. 51, Cic. in Catil. 3, c. 4), practically by the Stoics, who taught
  that there is a future existence of limited though indefinite length.

  immediately dependent on <i>quasi</i>, in the sense of <i>sicut</i> or
  <i>quem ad modum</i>. When two things are compared by <i>quasi ...

  Quintil. 1, 6, 17 condemns those who used <i>audaciter</i> for
  <i>audacter</i>, which latter form, he says, had been used by 'all
  orators'. Yet the form <i>audaciter</i> is pretty well attested by MSS.
  here and elsewhere in Cicero. [See Neue, Formenlehre, 1² 662.] For the
  two forms cf. <i>difficiliter, difficulter. Audaciter</i> is of
  importance as showing that <i>c</i> before <i>i</i> must have been

  makes Socrates there profess to quote Philolaus, the Pythagorean;
  Cic. therefore refers the doctrine to Pythagoras Cf. Tusc. 1, 74; Rep. 6,
  15. The Stoics held the same view about suicide, which they authorized in
  extreme cases, but much less freely than is commonly supposed; cf. Sen.
  Ep. 117, 22 <i>nihil mihi videtur turpius quam optare mortem</i>. See
  Zeller, Stoics, Epicureans, and Sceptics, Ch. 12, C (2); cf. also Lecky,
  Hist. of European Morals, I. p. 228 <i>et seq</i>. (Am. ed.) &mdash;

  translates it in Tusc. 1, 117 <i>Mors mea ne careat lacrimis, linquamus
  amicis Maerorem, ut celebrent funera cum gemitu</i>. The epitaph of
  Ennius is also quoted there and is declared to be better than that of
  Solon (cf. Tusc. 1, 34). &mdash; <b>volt se esse carum</b>: 'he wishes to
  make out that he is beloved'; <i>volt esse carus</i> would have had quite
  a different sense. Cf. Fin. 5, 13 <i>Strato physicum se volt</i>, with

  particular person; <i>e.g.</i> Att. 11, 24, 4 <i>Philotimus nullus

  Plato, says <i>tota philosophorum vita commentatio mortis est</i>. So
  Seneca, <i>tota vita discendum est mori</i>. &mdash; <b>sine qua ... nemo
  potest</b>: these words bring the position of Cicero with regard to death
  wonderfully near that of Lucretius: the latter argues that for peace of
  mind one must believe '<i>nullum esse sensum post mortem</i>'; the
  former's lesson is '<i>aut nullum esse sensum aut optandum</i>'. &mdash;

  no reason to suppose that he was a worse general than many other Romans
  who met Hannibal and were beaten; the early historians, being all
  aristocrats, fixed the disgrace of Cannae on the democratic consul.
  Varro's contemporaries were more just to him. Far from reproaching him,
  the Senate commended his spirit, and several times afterwards entrusted
  him with important business. &mdash; <b>Marcellum</b>: the captor of
  Syracuse in 212 B.C. He fell into an ambush in 208 and was killed;
  Hannibal buried him with military honors. &mdash; <b>cuius interitum</b>:

  calls the soul <i>divinae particulam aurae</i>. &mdash; <b>tuerentur</b>:
  rule, or guard, or care for. Most editors wrongly take <i>tuerentur</i>
  to be for <i>intuerentur</i>, 'to look upon', and regard it as an
  intentional archaism. But cf. Rep. 6, 15 (where no archaism can be
  intended): <i>homines sunt hac lege generati, qui tuerentur illum globum
  quae terra vocatur</i>; also <i>tuentur</i> below in <a
  href="#Sect_82">82</a>. &mdash; <b>contemplantes imitarentur</b>: perhaps
  more Stoic than Platonic; the Stoics laid great stress on the ethical
  value of a contemplation and imitation of the order of the universe. Cf.
  N.D. 2, 37 <i>ipse homo ortus est ad mundum contemplandum et
  imitandum</i>; Sen. Dial. 8, 5, 1 <i>Natura nos ad utrumque genuit, et

  <p><b><a name="Snot_78"></a><a href="#Sect_78">78.</a> Pythagoran</b>:
  see n. to 23. No ancient philosopher held more firmiy than Pythagoras to
  belief in the immortality of the soul; it formed a part of his doctrine
  of Metempsychosis. He was also noted for his numerical speculations in
  Astronomy and Music. With him is said to have originated the doctrine of
  the 'harmony of the spheres'. &mdash; <b>qui essent</b>: 'inasmuch as
  they were'. Cicero often tries to make out a connection between
  Pythagoras and the early Romans; cf. Tusc. 4, 2; also Liv. 1, 18. &mdash;
  <b>ex universa mente</b>: the world-soul. Diog. Laert 8 gives as
  Pythagorean the doctrine <span lang="el" title="psychên einai apospasma

  &#x3BA;&#x3B1;&#x3B9;
  &#x3B1;&#x3B8;&#x3B1;&#x3BD;&#x3B1;&#x3C4;&#x3BF;&#x3BD;</span>. Similar doctrines
  occur in Plato and the Stoics; cf. Div. 1, 110 <i>a qua (i.e. a natura
  deorum) ut doctissimis sapientissimisque placuit, haustos animos et
  libatos habemus</i>; Tusc. 5, 38 <i>humanus animus decerptus ex mente
  divina</i>; Sen. Dial. 12, 6, 7. &mdash; <b>haberemus</b>: imperfect
  where the English requires the present. A. 287, <i>d</i>; H. 495, V.
  &mdash; <b>Socrates</b>: in Plato's Phaedo. &mdash;
  <b>immortalitate animorum</b>: this is commoner than <i>immortalitas
  animi</i>, for 'the immortality of the soul'; so Lael. 14; Tusc. 1, 80
  <i>aeternitas animorum</i>. &mdash; <b>disseruisset</b>: subjunctive
  because involving the statements of some other person than the speaker.
  A. 341, <i>c</i>; G. 630; H. 528, 1. &mdash; <b>is qui esset</b> etc.: 'a
  man great enough to have been declared wisest'. See n. on Lael. 7
  <i>Apollinis ... iudicatum</i>. &mdash; <b>sic</b>: cf. <i>ita</i> above.
  &mdash; <b>celeritas animorum</b>: the ancients pictured to themselves
  the mind as a substance capable of exceedingly rapid movement; cf. Tusc.
  1, 43 <i>nulla est celeritas quae possit cum animi celeritate
  contendere</i>. &mdash; <b>tantae scientiae</b>: as the plural of
  <i>scientia</i> is almost unknown in classical Latin, recent editors take
  <i>scientiae</i> here as genitive, 'so many arts requiring so much
  knowledge'. In favor of this interpretation are such passages as Acad. 2,
  146 <i>artem sine scientia esse non posse</i>; Fin. 5, 26 <i>ut omnes
  artes in aliqua scientia versentur</i>. Yet in De Or. 1, 61 <i>physica
  ista et mathematica et quae paulo ante ceterarum artium propria posuisti,
  scientiae sunt eorum qui illa profitentur</i> it is very awkward to take
  <i>scientiae</i> as genitive. &mdash; <b>cumque semper</b> etc.: this
  argument is copied very closely from Plato's Phaedrus, 245 C. &mdash;
  <b>principium motus</b>: <span lang="el" title="archê kinêseôs">&#x3B1;&#x3C1;&#x3C7;&#x3B7;
  &#x3BA;&#x3B9;&#x3BD;&#x3B7;&#x3C3;&#x3B5;&#x3C9;&#x3C2;</span> in Plato.
  &mdash; <b>se ipse</b>: cf. <a href="#Snot_4">n. on 4</a> <i>a se
  ipsi</i>. &mdash; <b>cum simplex</b> etc: from Plato's Phaedo, 78-80. The
  general drift of the argument is this: material things decay because they
  are compounded of parts that fall asunder; there is nothing to show that
  the soul is so compounded; therefore no reason to believe that it will so
  decay. Notice the imperfects <i>esset ... haberet ... posset</i>
  accommodated to the tense of <i>persuasi</i> above, although the other
  subjunctives in the sentence are not; cf. <a href="#Snot_42">n. on 42</a>
  <i>efficeret</i>. &mdash; <b>neque ... dissimile</b>: in modern
  phraseology the whole of this clause would be briefly expressed thus,
  &mdash; 'and was homogeneous'. &mdash; <b>posset</b>: <i>quod si</i>
  ='whereas if', the subject of <i>posset</i> being <i>animus</i>, and
  <i>dividi</i> being understood. &mdash; <b>magno argumento</b>:
  <span lang="el" title="hikanon tekmêrion">&#x201B;&#x3B9;&#x3BA;&#x3B1;&#x3BD;&#x3BF;&#x3BD;
  &#x3C4;&#x3B5;&#x3BA;&#x3BC;&#x3B7;&#x3C1;&#x3B9;&#x3BF;&#x3BD;</span> in Pl. Phaed.
  72 A. Belief in the immortality of the soul naturally follows the
  acceptance of the doctrine of pre-existence. &mdash; <b>homines scire</b>
  etc.: See Plato, Phaedo, 72 E-73 B. The notion that the souls of men
  existed before the bodies with which they are connected has been held in
  all ages and has often found expression in literature. The English poets
  have not infrequently alluded to it. See Wordsworth's Ode on the
  Intimations of Immortality from the Recollections of Early Childhood,
  'Our birth is but a sleep and a forgetting' etc.; also, in Tennyson's Two
  Voices the passage beginning, &mdash;</p>

  <i>animus solutus ac vacuus</i>; De Or. 2, 193 <i>animo leni ac

  title="kosmon">&#x3BA;&#x3BF;&#x3C3;&#x3BC;&#x3BF;&#x3BD;</span>;
  Cic. translates it by <i>ornatus</i> in Acad. 2, 119 where <i>hic

  <i>et seq.</i>; Arch. 29. &mdash; <b>duos avos ... patruum</b>: see <a
  href="#Snot_29">nn. on 29</a>. &mdash; <b>multos</b>: <i>sc. alios</i>.
  &mdash; <b>esse conatos</b>: loosely put for <i>fuisse conaturos</i>, as
  below, <i>suscepturum fuisse</i>. So in the direct narration we might
  have, though exceptionally, <i>non conabantur nisi
  cernerent</i> for <i>non conati essent nisi vidissent</i>. &mdash;
  <b>cernerent</b>: see <a href="#Snot_13">n. on 13</a> quaereretur.
  &mdash; <b>ut ... glorier</b>: in Arch. 30 Cic. makes the same
  reflections in almost the same words about his own achievements. &mdash;
  <b>aliquid</b>: see <a href="#Snot_1">n. on 1</a> <i>quid</i>.</p>

  <p><b>P. <a href="#Page_34">34</a> &mdash; si isdem</b> etc.: cf. Arch.
  29 <i>si nihil animus praesentiret ... dimicaret</i>. &mdash;
  <b>aetatem</b>: = <i>vitam</i>. &mdash; <b>traducere</b>: cf. Tusc. 3, 25
  <i>volumus hoc quod datum est vitae tranquille placideque traducere.</i>
  &mdash; <b>nescio quo modo</b>: A. 210, <i>f</i>, Rem.; G. 469, Rem. 2;
  H. 529, 5, 3). &mdash; <b>erigens se</b>: Acad. 2, 127 <i>erigimur,
  elatiores fieri videmur</i>. &mdash; <b>haud ... niteretur</b>: in
  Cicero's speeches <i>haud</i> scarcely occurs except before adverbs and
  the verb <i>scio</i>; in the philosophical writings and in the Letters
  before many other verbs. &mdash; <b>immortalitatis gloriam</b>: so Balb.
  16 <i>sempiterni nominis gloriam</i>. Cf. also Arch. 26 <i>trahimur omnes
  studio laudis et optimus quisque maxime gloria ducitur</i>.</p>

  <p><b><a name="Snot_83"></a><a href="#Sect_83">83.</a> non videre</b>:
  either <i>non videre</i> or <i>non item</i> was to be expected, as Cicero
  does not often end sentences or clauses with <i>non</i>. &mdash; <b>colui
  et dilexi</b>: so <a href="#Sect_26">26</a> <i>coluntur et diliguntur</i>. &mdash;
  <b>videndi</b>: Cic. for the most part avoids the genitive plural of the
  gerundive in agreement with a noun, and uses the gerund as here. Meissner
  notes that Latin has no verb with the sense 'to see again', which a
  modern would use here. &mdash; <b>conscripsi</b>: in the <i>Origines</i>.
  &mdash; <b>quo</b>: = <i>ad quos</i>; see <a href="#Snot_12">n. on 12</a>
  <i>fore unde</i>. &mdash; <b>Pelian</b>: a mistake of Cicero's. It was
  not Pelias but his half-brother Aeson, father of Iason, whom Medea made
  young again by cutting him to pieces and boiling him in her enchanted
  cauldron. She, however, induced the daughters of Pelias to try the same
  experiment with their father; the issue, of course, was very different.
  Plautus, Pseud. 3, 2, 80 seems to make the same mistake. &mdash; <b>si
  quis deus</b>: the present subjunctive is noticeable; strictly, an
  impossible condition should require the past tense, but in vivid passages
  an impossible condition is momentarily treated as possible. So Cic.
  generally says <i>si reviviscat aliquis</i>, not <i>revivisceret</i>.
  &mdash; <b>decurso spatio</b>: 'when I have run my race'. See <a
  href="#Snot_14">n. on 14</a>. Lucretius 3, 1042 oddly has <i>decurso
  lumine vitae</i>. &mdash; <b>ad carceres a calce</b>: <i>carceres</i>
  were the barriers behind which the horses and cars stood waiting for the
  race; <i>calx</i> (<span lang="el"
  title="grammê">&#x3B3;&#x3C1;&#x3B1;&#x3BC;&#x3BC;&#x3B7;</span>), literally 'a
  chalked line', was what we should call 'the winning post'. Cf. Lael. 101;
  Tusc. 1, 15 <i>nunc video calcem ad quam cum sit decursum, nihil sit
  praeterea extimescendum.</i></p>

  <p><b><a name="Snot_84"></a><a href="#Sect_84">84.</a> habeat</b>:
  concessive. A. 266, <i>c</i>; G. 257; H. 484, 3. &mdash; <b>multi et ei
  docti</b>: as Nägelsbach, Stilistik § 25, 5, remarks, Cic. always
  uses this phrase and not <i>multi docti</i>. One of the books Cic. has in
  view is no doubt that of Hegesias, a Cyrenaic philosopher, mentioned in
  Tusc. 1, 84. &mdash; <b>commorandi ... divorsorium</b>: 'a hostelry
  wherein to sojourn'. The idea has been expressed in literature in a
  thousand ways. Cf. Lucr. 3, 938 <i>cur non ut plenus vitae conviva
  recedis</i>; Hor. Sat. 1, 1, 118 <i>vita cedat uti conviva satur</i>.
  Cicero often insists that heaven is the <i>vera aeternaque domus</i> of
  the soul (cf. Tusc. 1, 118). Cf. Epist. to the Hebrews, 13, 14 'Here have
  we no continuing city, but we seek one to come'. &mdash; <b>concilium
  coetumque</b>: so in Rep. 6, 13 <i>concilia coetusque hominum quae
  civitates vocantur</i>. The words here seem to imply that the real
  <i>civitas</i> is above; what seems to men a <i>civitas</i> is merely a
  disorganized crowd.</p>

  <p><b>P. <a href="#Page_35">35</a> &mdash; Catonem meum</b>: see <a
  href="#Sect_15">15</a>, <a href="#Sect_68">68</a>; so Cicero in his
  letters often calls his own son <i>meus Cicero</i>. &mdash; <b>nemo
  vir</b>: see <a href="#Snot_21">n. on 21</a> <i>quemquam senem</i>.
  &mdash; <b>quod contra</b>: = <span
  lang="el" title="ho tounantion">&#x201B;&#x3BF;
  &#x3C4;&#x3BF;&#x3C5;&#x3BD;&#x3B1;&#x3BD;&#x3C4;&#x3B9;&#x3BF;&#x3BD;</span>,
  'whereas on the contrary'; cf. n. on Lael. 90 where, as well as here,
  many of the editors make the mistake of taking <i>quod</i> to be the
  accusative governed by <i>contra</i> out of place. &mdash; <b>meum</b>:
  <i>sc. corpus cremari</i>. &mdash; <b>quo</b>: put for <i>ad quae</i>, as
  often. &mdash; <b>visus sum</b>: 'people thought I bore up bravely'.
  &mdash; <b>non quo ... sed</b>: a relative clause parallel with a
  categorically affirmative clause. The usage is not uncommon, though Cic.
  often has <i>non quo ... sed quia</i>. For mood of <i>ferrem</i> see A.
  341, <i>d</i>, Rem.; G. 541, Rem. 1.; H. 516, II. 2.</p>

  <p><b><a name="Snot_85"></a><a href="#Sect_85">85.</a> dixisti</b>: in <a href="#Sect_4">4.</a>
  &mdash; <b>qui</b>: here = <i>cum ego</i>, 'since I ...'. &mdash;
  <b>extorqueri volo</b>: <a href="#Snot_2">n. on 2</a> <i>levari volo</i>.
  &mdash; <b>minuti philosophi</b>: for the word <i>minutus</i> cf. <a
  href="#Snot_46">n. on 46</a>; Cic. has <i>minuti philosophi</i> in Acad.
  2, 75; Div. 1, 62; in Fin. 1, 61 <i>minuti et angusti (homines)</i>; in
  Brut. 265 <i>m. imperatores</i>; cf. Suet. Aug. 83 <i>m. pueri</i>.
  &mdash; <b>sentiam</b>: future indicative. &mdash; <b>peractio</b>: the
  noun is said to occur only here in Cic.; cf. however <a
  href="#Sect_64">64</a> <i>peragere</i>; <a href="#Sect_70">70</a>.
  &mdash; <b>haec ... dicerem</b>: the same words occur at the end of the
  Laelius; for <i>habeo quod dicam</i> Cic. often says <i>habeo dicere</i>,
  as in Balb. 34.</p>

<p class="note"><a name="Nt_3"></a><a href="#NtA_3">[3]</a> To judge rightly of Cicero it must be remembered that he was a politician only by accident: his whole natural bent was towards literature.</p>
<p class="note"><a name="Nt_4"></a><a href="#NtA_4">[4]</a> To see the truth of this it is only necessary to refer for example to the weight given to the opinions of Cicero in the heated political discussions of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.</p>
<p class="note"><a name="Nt_5"></a><a href="#NtA_5">[5]</a> Almost every branch of learning was ranked under the head of Philosophy. Strabo even claimed that one branch of Philosophy was Geography.</p>
<p class="note"><a name="Nt_6"></a><a href="#NtA_6">[6]</a> 2, 3 <i>interiectus est nuper liber is quem ad nostrum Atticum de senectute misimus.</i> No argument can be founded on the words <i>interiectus est</i>, over which the editors have wasted much ingenuity. They simply mean 'there was inserted in the series of my works'.</p>
<p class="note"><a name="Nt_7"></a><a href="#NtA_7">[7]</a> See 2, 23.</p>

<p class="note"><a name="Nt_10"></a><a href="#NtA_10">[10]</a> It was certainly not written, as Sommerbrodt assumes, in the intervals of composing the <i>De Divinatione</i>. The words in 2, 7 of that work&mdash;<i>quoniam de re publica consuli coepti sumus</i> etc.&mdash;point to the end of September or beginning of October, 44, when Cicero returned to Rome and began to compose his Philippic orations.</p>

<p class="note"><a name="Nt_12"></a><a href="#NtA_12">[12]</a> It is perhaps not a mere accident that the prowess of L. Brutus <i>in liberanda patria</i> is mentioned in § <a href="#Sect_75">75</a>. There may be a reference to the latest Brutus who had freed his country.</p>
<p class="note"><a name="Nt_13"></a><a href="#NtA_13">[13]</a> In March, 45.</p>

<p class="note"><a name="Nt_21"></a><a href="#NtA_21">[21]</a> Works on Old Age are said to have been written by Theophrastus and Demetrius Phalereus, either or both of which Cicero might have used. One passage in § <a href="#Sect_67">67</a>, <i>facilius in morbos ... tristius curantur</i>, is supposed by many to have been imitated from Hippocrates; but the resemblance is probably accidental. Cf. De Off. 1, 24, 83.</p>

<p class="note"><a name="Nt_25"></a><a href="#NtA_25">[25]</a> As Cicero's intention was to set old age in a favorable light, he slights Aristo Cius for giving to Tithonus the chief part in a dialogue on old age. See § <a href="#Sect_3">3</a>; cf. also Laelius, § 4.</p>
<p class="note"><a name="Nt_26"></a><a href="#NtA_26">[26]</a> See below <a href="#Page_xxiii">(ii.), 1.</a></p>

<p class="note"><a name="Nt_29"></a><a href="#NtA_29">[29]</a> Cicero always indicates this date; cf. § <a href="#Sect_14">14</a>. Some other writers, as Livy, give, probably wrongly, an earlier date.</p>
<p class="note"><a name="Nt_30"></a><a href="#NtA_30">[30]</a> He himself says (Festus, p.28l) <i>ego iam a principio in parsimonia atque in duritia atque industria omnem adulescentiam, abstinui agro colendo, saxis Sabinis silicibus repastinandis atque conserendis</i>. Cf. Gell. <i>Noct. Att.</i> 13, 23.</p>

<p class="note"><a name="Nt_34"></a><a href="#NtA_34">[34]</a> If Plutarch may be trusted, Cato at the age of 30 had won for himself the title of 'the Roman Demosthenes'.</p>

<p class="note"><a name="Nt_36"></a><a href="#NtA_36">[36]</a> In § <a href="#Sect_10">10</a> Cicero makes the quaestorship fall in 205, but he refers to the election, not to the actual year of office.</p>

<p class="note"><a name="Nt_38"></a><a href="#NtA_38">[38]</a> Cato afterwards made it a charge against M. Fulvius Nobilior that he had taken Ennius with him on a campaign (Tusc. 1, 3). But Cato used Ennius as soldier while Nobilior employed him as poet.</p>
<p class="note"><a name="Nt_39"></a><a href="#NtA_39">39</a> It is difficult, however, to fix the date of this enactment. Some authorities place it after Cato's return from Spain.</p>

<p class="note"><a name="Nt_43"></a><a href="#NtA_43">[43]</a> Cicero's statements throughout the treatise concerning the relations between Cato and Africanus the elder, particularly in § <a href="#Sect_77">77</a> where Cato calls his enemy <i>amicissimus</i>, are audaciously inexact.</p>

(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
